# Clean-room tooling

## `clean_room_gate.py` — R35 / R36 residual-similarity gate

Automated implementation of the residual-similarity gate that
[`docs/reloaded-rewrite/01-clean-room-rules.md`](../docs/reloaded-rewrite/01-clean-room-rules.md)
defers (rule **R35**, deferral **D1**, and chapter 30). The gate scores a
reloaded file's **discretionary expression** against a *relicensed historical
record* reference and never reads the forbidden corpus (R8).

### What it measures

R35 forbids using a whole-file similarity figure as a clean-room gate for
interface-dense files: signatures, serde renames, schema names, `#[repr]`
discriminants, pinned constants, and import lists are *required* to match, so
their matching proves nothing. The gate therefore scores the **discretionary
body** (function bodies, helper decomposition, control flow, local naming,
comment/diagnostic wording) after stripping comments and normalizing
whitespace, with pinned-interface / R28–R33 lines excluded from the measured
set.

A file **passes** when its discretionary-body similarity is materially below its
whole-file similarity (configurable margin) and under an absolute cap. Residual
byte-identical discretionary lines are listed so a reviewer can confirm each is
attributable to an excluded fragment, as R35 requires.

### Marking excluded (pinned) lines

Exclusion is explicit, matching the CRD requirement that reused fragments be
*marked* at the point of reuse:

| Marker | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `// crd:pin` (end of line) | exclude that single line |
| `// crd:pin-begin` … `// crd:pin-end` | exclude the enclosed block |
| `// crd:r28` … `// crd:r33` | exclude one line, recording its fragment class |

`#` comment markers work too (for non-Rust files). `--auto-pin` additionally
excludes obvious structural interface lines (imports, `fn`/`struct`/`enum`/
`trait`/`impl` signatures, `#[repr(...)]`, serde `rename`); it is advisory —
explicit markers are authoritative.

### Usage

```sh
# Gate everything listed in the manifest (the canonical invocation)
python3 tools/clean_room_gate.py \
  --manifest tools/clean_room_gate.manifest.json --auto-pin

# One-off check against the relicensed historical record
python3 tools/clean_room_gate.py \
  --reloaded mm2src/foo/src/bar.rs \
  --reference git:c1d46c0c1592faa0860f704008b2b2381bc3840f:mm2src/foo/src/bar.rs \
  --verbose
```

### Run it on *formatted* code

The gate compares **normalized line lists**, so how source is split across lines
affects the score. This repository's `rustfmt.toml` is the same canonical style
upstream uses, so leaving code hand-formatted can mask real structural
similarity behind cosmetic line-break differences. The honest, format-invariant
standard is therefore:

```sh
cargo +nightly-2026-05-08 fmt --all
python3 tools/clean_room_gate.py \
  --manifest tools/clean_room_gate.manifest.json --auto-pin
```

A file is only considered to pass when it passes **after** `cargo fmt`. The
whole manifest currently passes 51/51 under this format-invariant standard.

### Manifest format

`clean_room_gate.manifest.json` is an object: `reference_origin` pins the
relicensed historical-record tree independence is asserted from, `defaults`
holds the thresholds (`margin`, `max_discretionary`, `margin_floor`), and
`files` is the list of gated entries. Each entry names a reloaded file and its
upstream `reference` path; the gate expands it to
`git:<reference_origin.commit>:<path>` and resolves it inside a gated reference
repository (the upstream tree is never vendored here — only similarity scores
cross back). Per-file `interface_only: true` waives the cap/margin for
re-export / module-glue shims that are identical by structural necessity.

```json
{
  "reference_origin": { "commit": "<upstream commit>", "...": "..." },
  "defaults": { "margin": 0.15, "max_discretionary": 0.50, "margin_floor": 0.50 },
  "files": [
    { "reloaded": "mm2src/foo/src/bar.rs", "reference": "mm2src/foo/src/bar.rs" }
  ]
}
```

### How the gate is run

The gate is run **locally** at chapter-edit and pre-publication time — this is
the manual audit boundary that chapter 30 (D1) describes as deferred. It is not
wired into CI: the reference comparison needs the relicensed historical record,
which is not vendored into this repository, so the gate is exercised by the
maintainer against a local reference checkout rather than on hosted CI runners.
