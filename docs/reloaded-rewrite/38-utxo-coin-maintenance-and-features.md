# Chapter 38 -- UTXO Coin Maintenance & Features

**Status:** driving-spec (as-built baseline **plus** required-but-unimplemented
extensions). Mixed treatment -- see §38.0.

> **One-sentence claim:** the project shall provide a UTXO coin-support layer
> covering Qtum specialisation, config-driven coinbase maturity, multiple
> withdraw/spend address types, KMD interest/rewards handling, a raw-transaction
> signing RPC, a UTXO-consolidation RPC, and a configuration-selected
> chain-variant model -- and shall additionally grow, by required port, the
> post-2022 UTXO features reloaded does not yet carry (PoSV coins, Taproot
> output handling, P2PK balance, Electrum connection prioritisation, UTXO balance
> event streaming, fixed-fee/min-volume policy, and FIRO Spark verbose tx).

## 38.0 Treatment & scope split

This chapter is a brand-new chapter spanning a broad UTXO feature surface.
Reloaded ships some of it and lacks the rest, so the chapter is split:

- **§38.1--§38.5 (T-DOC, as-built):** capabilities verified present in reloaded
  -- Qtum split & staking-param naming, config-driven maturity, baseline address
  types (P2PKH / P2SH / segwit v0), KMD rewards/dust policy, `sign_raw_transaction`,
  `consolidate_utxos`, and the chain-variant model (shared with
  [chapter 37](37-utxo-spv-and-block-header-validation.md) §37.5).
  Exception: the KIP-0001 reward reduction of R38.4.1 is required but NOT
  as-built (issue #11; see §38.4).
- **§38.6 (T-PORT, required, NOT yet in reloaded):** capabilities verified
  **absent** in reloaded that must be ported -- PoSV support, Taproot output
  parsing & withdraw guard, P2PK show/spend, Electrum connection prioritisation
  (min/max connected + server ordering), UTXO balance event streaming,
  fixed-tx-fee ("dingo") option and fixed-fee-derived minimum trading volume, and
  FIRO Spark verbose-tx support.
- **§38.8 (T-PORT, required, NOT yet in reloaded):** software (non-hardware)
  global-HD UTXO accounts -- storage availability, account-`0` bootstrap at
  activation, `get_new_address` advance, and gap/scan semantics for BIP-44 and
  BIP-84 coins -- consuming the Chapter 5 §5.9A software-HD crypto substrate.

> **Binding scope (R36).** Requirements bind observable behaviour, public RPC
> method strings / request-response field names, coins-config keys, and dictated
> script/format semantics (output script types, sighash variants). Private types,
> helper decomposition, and diagnostic wording are informative.

---

## Part A -- As-built baseline (T-DOC)

## 38.1 Qtum specialisation

R38.1.1 Qtum-specific behaviour shall be separated from the shared UTXO path so
that Qtum staking/delegation does not perturb generic UTXO coins.

R38.1.2 Qtum delegation RPCs shall use a parameter name consistent with the
Cosmos staking surface (a `validator_address` field), and Qtum staking RPCs are
exposed under the staking namespace (`get_staking_infos`, and the
`experimental::staking::` namespace).

## 38.2 Config-driven coinbase maturity

R38.2.1 A coin's coinbase-maturity / maturity-check behaviour shall be read from
the coins configuration (a `check_utxo_maturity`-style config key) rather than
hardcoded, so a coin can declare its own maturity policy.

## 38.3 Baseline address types

R38.3.1 The withdraw and spend paths shall support the legacy P2PKH, P2SH, and
segwit **v0** (P2WPKH) address/output types. Non-segwit coins shall be allowed to
withdraw to P2SH addresses.

R38.3.2 Output-script creation shall follow an address-builder model in which an
address carries its script type, and the signing path shall parse scriptSig
signatures tolerantly across real-world P2PKH variants.

R38.3.3 **HD derivation-path purpose generality.** When a UTXO coin's
coins-config supplies a `derivation_path` and the daemon is in HD mode, the coin
activation path and every UTXO HD consumer that parses that config field (the
account-derivation machinery, the new-address derivation RPC, the my-address RPC,
and the private-key-export RPC) shall deserialize it with the generic
purpose-level standard HD path of Chapter 5 R18 (`HDPathToCoin` /
`HDPathToAccount`), which accepts every standard BIP-43 purpose (32, 44, 49, 84).
These consumers shall NOT use the strict BIP-44 alias of Chapter 5 R19, whose
purpose level is pinned to 44 and which therefore rejects any other purpose.
Consequently a UTXO coin whose `derivation_path` declares a non-44 purpose — in
particular BIP-84 native segwit (`m/84'/<coin_type>'`) or BIP-49 nested segwit
(`m/49'/<coin_type>'`) — shall activate and derive HD addresses, instead of being
refused at activation with a purpose-mismatch error. The strict BIP-44 alias
remains reserved for fixed/internal paths only (e.g. the bound internal key path
of Chapter 5 R16); coins whose configured path is genuinely BIP-44 (such as the
EVM `m/44'/60'` family) are unaffected, since BIP-44 is a subset of the accepted
purposes. Acceptance (two-direction): a UTXO segwit coin configured with an
`m/84'` `derivation_path` activates in HD mode and a freshly derived external HD
address advances the address index under that same purpose; a UTXO coin
configured with an `m/44'` `derivation_path` continues to activate and derive.
Each derived address's reported `derivation_path` carries the configured purpose.

R38.3.4 **Withdraw-request derivation-path purpose generality (fifth
consumer).** The withdraw RPC's own `from` selector, when supplied as an
explicit derivation-path string (as opposed to being omitted, or supplied as
the structured account/chain/address-index selector), is a fifth UTXO HD
consumer of the purpose-generic parse rule R38.3.3 binds — not an exception to
it. The withdraw sender-resolution path shall deserialize that string with the
same generic purpose-level standard HD path of Chapter 5 R18, exactly as the
four consumers R38.3.3 names, and shall NOT use the strict BIP-44 alias of
Chapter 5 R19. Only the coin-type component of the parsed path is validated
against the activated coin's own configured SLIP-44 coin type; the account,
chain, and address-index components select which already-derived HD address
the withdrawal is sent from, and the resolved address itself is always the one
the coin's own configured account extended public key derives at that
account/chain/index — the purpose digit the caller supplies is not itself
trusted as a derivation input, only checked for being one of the recognised
BIP-43 purposes (32, 44, 49, 84) so a malformed or nonsensical path is still
rejected. Consequently a UTXO coin configured with a non-44 purpose (BIP-84
native segwit or BIP-49 nested segwit, per R38.3.3) shall accept a withdraw
`from.derivation_path` written at that same purpose, instead of being refused
with a purpose-mismatch error merely because the purpose is not 44. Acceptance
(two-direction): a UTXO segwit coin activated with an `m/84'` `derivation_path`
(R38.3.3) accepts a withdraw request whose `from.derivation_path` is a full
`purpose'/coin_type'/account'/chain/address_index` string at purpose `84'`
naming an already-derived address, and resolves it to the same sender address
the my-address / new-address consumers report for that path (two-direction
with R38.3.3's own acceptance); the same coin's withdraw continues to be
refused when the path's coin-type component does not match the activated
coin, independent of the path's purpose. This rule binds the same coin family
this chapter otherwise covers (UTXO); the identically-shaped question for
non-UTXO coin families that also accept an explicit withdraw derivation path
is outside this chapter's scope.

## 38.4 KMD interest / rewards & dust policy

> **Status of §38.4 (corrected 2026-09-27, issue #11).** §38.0 lists this
> section as as-built. R38.4.1 was not: the reloaded tree carries the
> pre-2023 reward rule without the KIP-0001 reduction. See the
> code-quality finding after R38.4.1B. R38.4.2 is unchanged.

R38.4.1 **Reward amount (consensus-dictated).** The KMD active-user reward
(AUR, also called "interest") that the project computes for one KMD UTXO
MUST equal the amount the Komodo consensus rule allows for that UTXO. The
rule comes from the public Komodo daemon and KIP-0001 (§38.10). It is
evaluated in unsigned 64-bit integer arithmetic, with no floating point,
from four inputs:

- `value` is the UTXO value in base units (1 KMD = 10^8);
- `utxo_height` is the block height at which the UTXO's transaction was
  confirmed;
- `utxo_lock_time` is the `nLockTime` of the transaction that created the
  UTXO;
- `ref_time` is the reference time given by R38.4.1A.

The reward is zero, and a not-accrued reason is reported where the surface
reports one, when any of these holds:

- `value` < 1,000,000,000 (10 KMD);
- `utxo_lock_time` is 0 or < 500,000,000;
- the UTXO is unconfirmed;
- `utxo_height` ≥ 7,777,777 (end of era);
- `ref_time` < `utxo_lock_time`;
- fewer than 60 whole minutes have passed.

Otherwise:

1. `minutes = floor((ref_time − utxo_lock_time) / 60)`;
2. cap `minutes` at 525,600 (one year);
3. if `utxo_height` ≥ 1,000,000, also cap `minutes` at 44,640 (31 days);
4. `minutes = minutes − 59`;
5. `reward = floor(value / 10,512,000) × minutes`;
6. **KIP-0001 reduction:** if `utxo_height` ≥ 3,484,958 (the dPoW Season-7
   hard-fork height), `reward = floor(reward / 500)`.

Each step truncates, and the steps run in the order given. Step 6 depends on
the height of the UTXO being spent. It does not depend on the current chain
height or on the height of the spending transaction. This matches the
consensus rule. A UTXO confirmed before 3,484,958 keeps the pre-reduction
rate, capped as in steps 2–3.

R38.4.1A **One rule, every surface.** R38.4.1 MUST be the only reward
computation. Every KMD surface that computes, claims, or reports a reward
MUST use it:

| Surface | `ref_time` |
| --- | --- |
| Building any KMD spend (withdraw, taker fee, swap payments, any send from the wallet), when the reward is added to the wallet's own output or change | the lock time the new transaction will carry: the current median-time-past used as its `nLockTime` |
| Transaction-history reward reporting (`kmd_rewards` on history entries) | the spending transaction's `nLockTime` |
| The `kmd_rewards_info` RPC (`accrued_rewards`) | the current median-time-past |
| Withdraw / transaction-details `kmd_rewards` | the same value as the build row |

A transaction built from R38.4.1 MUST NOT claim more reward than the
consensus rule allows at the transaction's own lock time. If it does, the
network rejects it (`bad-txns-in-belowout`, which is the daemon's
public-network error; see §38.10).

R38.4.1B **Lock time when nothing is claimed.** If the build row of
R38.4.1A computes zero total reward for a KMD transaction, the transaction's
`nLockTime` MUST be set to the current wall-clock time minus 2,046 seconds
(one hour minus two 777-second windows). This keeps the claimable window
open for later spends of its outputs. The netid-8762 and netid-6133
references both behave this way, and so does the baseline. It explains why
a no-reward KMD transaction's lock time trails the wall clock by about 34
minutes. It is not a defect.

> **Code-quality finding (informative; explicit look requested for issue
> #11).** The reloaded reward computation stops after step 5 of R38.4.1: it
> never applies the KIP-0001 reduction. Every reward-computing surface of
> R38.4.1A therefore overstates the reward 500× for any UTXO confirmed at or
> after height 3,484,958. On the build surface this is funds-affecting. Any
> KMD spend whose inputs include an eligible post-fork UTXO (value ≥ 10 KMD,
> at least an hour old) claims about 500× the allowed reward, and the network
> rejects it. Taker fees, swap payments, and withdraws are all affected.
> Issue #11's taker-fee rejection is this case: a 14.73232138 KMD UTXO at
> height 5,108,257 was spent with a lock-time difference of 12,518 minutes,
> and the transaction claimed 1,744,260 base units where the rule allows
> 3,488. History and `kmd_rewards_info` show the same inflated figures but
> do not move funds. *Proposed fix:* add step 6 to the single reward
> computation, keyed on the spent UTXO's confirmation height, and keep all
> other steps unchanged. Every surface then inherits the fix. Both reference
> lineages (`v2.6.0-beta` for netid 8762 and the v3 lineage for netid 6133)
> apply the reduction, so the fix needs no per-netid switch.

R38.4.2 When a KMD transaction's change plus accrued interest is at or below the
dust threshold, the accrued rewards shall be applied toward fees rather than
producing a dust output.

R38.4.3 **Tests (exact values, deterministic).** Every case uses the
integer rule of R38.4.1.

- *Issue #11 vector, post-fork.* `value` 1,473,232,138, `utxo_height`
  5,108,257, `utxo_lock_time` 1,789,721,423, `ref_time` 1,790,472,552. This
  gives 12,518 elapsed minutes and 12,459 after step 4. The reward MUST be
  exactly **3,488** base units. The pre-reduction figure 1,744,260 MUST NOT
  be produced.
- *Same vector, pre-fork height.* With `utxo_height` 3,484,957 and every
  other input unchanged, the reward MUST be exactly 1,744,260.
- *Fork boundary.* With `utxo_height` exactly 3,484,958, the reward MUST be
  3,488.
- *Legacy regression.* `value` 64,605,500,822, `utxo_height` 1,000,001,
  `utxo_lock_time` 1,556,623,906, `ref_time` = `utxo_lock_time` + 3,900: the
  reward MUST stay 36,870, because this UTXO is below the fork height. The
  existing not-accrued-reason cases (below 10 KMD, unconfirmed, lock time
  unset or below threshold, end of era, reference time before lock time,
  under one hour) MUST keep their current results.
- *Build-surface integration.* A KMD transaction built by the wallet's
  transaction builder, spending the issue #11 UTXO with lock time
  1,790,472,552, MUST add exactly 3,488 base units of reward to the wallet's
  own output. A UTXO of at least 10 KMD that is still younger than one hour
  MUST add zero and MUST get the lock time of R38.4.1B.
- *Surface agreement.* For one fixed UTXO and reference time, the history
  entry's `kmd_rewards`, the `kmd_rewards_info` `accrued_rewards`, and the
  built transaction's claimed reward MUST all equal the R38.4.1 value.

> **Implementation obligations (for the Coder; clean terms).**
> - *Reward computation:* the single KMD reward computation in
>   `mm2src/coins/utxo.rs` gains step 6 of R38.4.1. Its callers are the
>   spend builder in `mm2src/coins/utxo/utxo_common/utxo_common_tx.rs`,
>   history in `utxo_common_history.rs`, and the rewards-info RPC in
>   `utxo.rs`. They need no change beyond inheriting it.
> - *Tests:* extend `test_kmd_interest` in `mm2src/coins/utxo/utxo_tests.rs`
>   with the R38.4.3 vectors, keeping its existing cases, and add the
>   build-surface and surface-agreement tests.
> - *Changelog:* add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry stating that KMD spends of
>   post-hard-fork UTXOs no longer over-claim rewards.

## 38.5 Raw-tx signing, consolidation & chain variants

R38.5.1 The public `sign_raw_transaction` RPC shall sign a supplied raw
transaction for a UTXO coin (and is shared with the EVM path), returning the
signed transaction hex.

R38.5.2 The public `consolidate_utxos` RPC shall merge many UTXOs of a coin into
a single self-directed output under configurable merge conditions, with an
optional broadcast flag; when broadcast is not requested it returns the
constructed transaction without sending it.

R38.5.3 The coin's header/byte handling shall use the configuration-selected
chain-variant model defined in
[chapter 37](37-utxo-spv-and-block-header-validation.md) §37.5 (shared
contract). Chapter 37 additionally binds the SPV activation configuration,
header-store, and confirmation-proof behaviour a UTXO coin may separately
opt into; this chapter does not restate it.

## Part B -- Required, NOT yet in reloaded (T-PORT)

> **Status of Part B:** required ports. Each item below was checked against the
> reloaded UTXO tree during step 7; unless an item is marked inline as already
> as-built, it was found absent and implemented in step 7.

## 38.6 Required UTXO feature ports

### 38.6.1 PoSV (proof-of-stake-velocity) coins
R38.6.1 The project shall support PoSV/PoS-style UTXO coins: serialize,
deserialize and sign transactions that carry an `n_time` field, gated by a
coins-config flag (`isPoS`) declaring the coin as PoS/PoSV. Acceptance: such a
coin's withdraw produces a transaction whose `n_time` is present and accepted by
the network.
>
> **Status: as-built (T-DOC).** Verified present in the reloaded UTXO tree during
> step 7. The `isPoS` coins-config flag drives an optional `n_time` field on the
> transaction primitive: it is written by the witness-stripped serializer and
> recovered by the PoS deserialization path (auto-detected by the multi-format
> transaction decoder). A serialize/deserialize round-trip regression test locks
> the contract. No further feature code was required.

### 38.6.2 Taproot output handling
R38.6.2 Until full Taproot spending is supported, a withdraw whose destination is
a Taproot (witness v1 / bech32m) address shall be rejected with a clear
unsupported-address error rather than mis-encoded. Separately, the verbose-tx
parser shall be able to **recognise** Taproot output address types returned by
`blockchain.transaction.get`. Acceptance: withdraw to a bech32m address is
refused; a verbose tx with a Taproot output parses without error.

### 38.6.3 P2PK show & spend
R38.6.3 The project shall display a P2PK balance as part of the legacy
(P2PKH) address balance and shall be able to spend P2PK inputs in withdraws and
swaps. For P2PK inputs (whose scriptSig carries only the signature, not the
pubkey), the expected pubkey shall be validated against the signature rather than
extracted from the scriptSig. Acceptance: a P2PK UTXO contributes to balance and
can be spent.

### 38.6.4 Electrum connection prioritisation
R38.6.4 The Electrum client shall support configurable minimum and maximum
connected-server counts and shall prioritise servers by their order in the
configured list (including a single-server mode). Block-count queries across
servers shall be performed sequentially rather than all in parallel. Server-
version negotiation shall be race-free. A transaction wait-for-confirmation shall
use a bounded timeout and retry if the tx is not yet on chain. Acceptance: with a
list of servers, connections are bounded and ordered by priority; a downed server
does not stall block-count discovery.

### 38.6.5 UTXO balance event streaming
R38.6.5 For Electrum-backed UTXO coins the project shall emit balance-change
events over the streaming infrastructure, registering the addresses to be watched
at enable time (and re-registering as needed). Acceptance: a balance change on a
watched address produces a streamed balance event.

### 38.6.6 Fixed-fee option & min-trading-volume policy
R38.6.6 The project shall support a fixed per-transaction fee option for
fixed-fee UTXO coins (a coins-config flag, "dingo_fee"-style, that rounds tx size
up), and shall, for fixed-fee coins, derive the minimum trading volume from the
fixed fee (on the order of max(10x dust, 10x(fee-per-kB x ~496 bytes))) while
dynamic-fee coins remain dust-based. Acceptance: a fixed-fee coin reports a
fee-derived `min_trading_vol`; a dynamic-fee coin remains dust-based.

### 38.6.7 FIRO Spark verbose-tx support
R38.6.7 The project shall parse FIRO Spark verbose transactions (the
Spark-specific script/output types) so FIRO activates and transacts. Acceptance:
a FIRO Spark verbose tx parses and its details render.

### 38.6.8 Verus-family verbose-tx script labels
R38.6.8 The project shall parse Verus / VRSC-family verbose transactions whose
`scriptPubKey.type` is `cryptocondition`, including vARRR, vDEX, CHIPS, and
other coins using the same verbose transaction shape. Acceptance: a verbose
transaction output with `type: "cryptocondition"` deserializes without falling
back to an error path that skips transaction-history processing.

## 38.8 Software global-HD UTXO accounts & address derivation (T-PORT)

> **Status of §38.8:** required port. The reloaded UTXO HD path can only obtain
> an account extended public key through a hardware device; a **software**
> (non-hardware) global-HD account therefore cannot create an HD account or
> derive HD addresses. This section binds the software-HD UTXO behaviour as
> first-class, testable requirements. It is the coin-side consumer of Chapter 5
> §5.9A (R29–R31), which binds the crypto substrate (software wallet identity,
> software account-xpub derivation and canonical serialisation, and source
> selection by key-pair policy). §38.8 binds the UTXO account bootstrap, the
> `get_new_address` advance, and the scan/gap behaviour for both BIP-44 and
> BIP-84 coins. It cross-references Chapter 5 R15–R20, R29–R31; Chapter 7 R28;
> §38.3.3 (HD purpose generality); and Chapter 45 R45.4.8 (HD-mode identity
> selection).

R38.8.1 **Software-HD storage availability.** When a UTXO coin is activated in
HD mode under a software global-HD account (key-pair policy `GlobalHDAccount`,
selected by Chapter 45 R45.4.8 / Chapter 7 R28; no hardware device present), the
coin's per-wallet HD-account storage MUST initialise successfully using the
software wallet-identity digest of Chapter 5 R29 (the in-context
`RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey))` identity, equal to the daemon-wide `mm2_rmd160`).
It MUST NOT be refused on the grounds that no hardware device is connected. Iguana mode remains unsupported for HD (the request is
refused); hardware mode is unchanged. The on-disk identity namespacing
(`mm2_rmd160`, `hd_wallet_rmd160` columns) is unchanged; in software mode both
take the same software-derived value.

R38.8.2 **Account-0 bootstrap at activation.** Activating a software-HD UTXO
coin MUST establish HD account `0` so the coin is usable immediately after
activation. The observable contract matches the existing enable-HD-wallet flow:
HD accounts are loaded from storage at activation, and **if none exist the
default account `0` is created at activation time** (its account-level extended
public key derived in software per Chapter 5 R30 at the configured
`purpose'/coin_type'/0'` path), persisted with its canonical `account_xpub`, and
returned in the activation balance result; if accounts already exist they are
loaded and re-bound. After a successful software-HD activation the coin exposes
at least account `0`. This bootstrap MUST NOT require a `trezor_coin` config
field and MUST NOT contact a hardware device.

R38.8.3 **`get_new_address` advance (software HD).** For a software-HD UTXO coin
the public `get_new_address` RPC MUST advance the **external-chain** (BIP-44
chain `External`) address index under the requested `account_id` (default
account `0`) and return the freshly derived address together with its full
`derivation_path`, its `chain`, and its `balance`. The returned
`derivation_path` MUST carry the coin's configured BIP-43 purpose (44, 49, or 84
per §38.3.3) and an address index one greater than the previous external
known-addresses count for that account; successive calls MUST return successive
addresses. The derived address MUST equal the address a conformant reference
wallet derives from the same mnemonic at the same full derivation path
(`purpose'/coin_type'/account'/0/address_index`), which follows from the
canonical account-xpub contract of Chapter 5 R30. The request/response field
names are the existing wire surface: request `coin`, `account_id`, `chain`;
response `new_address` carrying `address`, `derivation_path`, `chain`,
`balance`.

R38.8.4 **`can_get_new_address` and gap-limit semantics.** The new-address
preconditions and gap-limit accounting that govern hardware HD MUST hold
identically for software HD: an address may be added when within the account's
gap limit of the last used address; scanning for new addresses
(`scan_for_new_addresses`) under account `0` discovers used addresses up to the
gap limit and advances the known-addresses count accordingly. These semantics
MUST work for both BIP-44 (legacy/P2PKH) and BIP-84 (native segwit / P2WPKH)
UTXO coins; the only per-coin difference is the address encoding, not the
derivation or gap accounting.

R38.8.5 **Minimum activation address count and empty-balance shape.** The
API-v2 UTXO activation parameters accept the optional non-negative integer
field `min_addresses_number`. In HD mode, after applying `scan_policy`, each
loaded or newly created HD account MUST have at least that many known
external-chain addresses. Missing addresses are derived at the next contiguous
indices, their known-address count is persisted, and their address,
`derivation_path`, `chain`, and ticker-keyed balance are included in the
activation result. Accounts that already meet the requested minimum MUST NOT
advance. An omitted or zero minimum MUST preserve the existing count and MUST
NOT force an address to be generated. The field has no effect in Iguana mode.

Every HD account's `total_balance` MUST contain the activated coin's ticker
even when the account has no known addresses or every balance is zero. The
empty-account representation is therefore a one-entry ticker-keyed map whose
value is a zero `CoinBalance`, not an untyped empty object. This preserves the
wire shape consumed by wallet SDKs and keeps an intentionally empty HD wallet
distinguishable from a malformed balance response.

R38.8.6 **Tests (two-direction, observable).**
- *Segwit (BIP-84) software-HD activation & advance.* A software-HD UTXO segwit
  coin configured with an `m/84'/<coin_type>'` `derivation_path` activates,
  exposes account `0`, and successive `get_new_address` calls return successive
  external addresses whose reported `derivation_path` carries purpose `84'` and
  an incrementing address index; the returned addresses match those a reference
  wallet derives from the same mnemonic at those paths.
- *Legacy (BIP-44) software-HD equivalence.* A software-HD UTXO coin configured
  with an `m/44'/<coin_type>'` `derivation_path` behaves equivalently
  (activates, exposes account `0`, advances external addresses; addresses match
  the reference wallet).
- *Negative (Iguana refusal).* With the daemon in Iguana (non-HD) mode, an HD
  request — coin activation in HD mode or `get_new_address` — is refused (HD is
  unavailable in Iguana mode); no software HD account is created.
- *Minimum-address activation.* Deserialising an HD UTXO activation with
  `min_addresses_number: 1` and enabling an account with zero known addresses
  persists and returns external address `0`. Re-enabling an account that
  already meets the minimum does not advance it; omitting the field or setting
  it to zero does not create an address.
- *Empty-balance response.* Aggregating no HD address balances still returns
  the activated ticker mapped to a zero `CoinBalance`.

## 38.7 Acceptance criteria (chapter)

- Baseline (Part A) RPCs `sign_raw_transaction` and `consolidate_utxos` behave
  per §38.5; Qtum staking uses `validator_address`; maturity is config-driven.
- KMD reward computation follows R38.4.1–R38.4.1B on every surface of
  R38.4.1A, and the exact-value tests of R38.4.3 pass (issue #11 vector:
  3,488 base units, not 1,744,260).
- Each Part-B item (R38.6.1--R38.6.8) is implemented with the acceptance test
  stated inline, and its coins-config keys / RPC field additions are documented
  alongside the implementation.
- §38.8 software global-HD UTXO behaviour (R38.8.1--R38.8.6) is implemented: a
  software-HD UTXO coin (BIP-84 and BIP-44) activates without a hardware device,
  exposes account `0`, honours the requested minimum external-address count,
  returns ticker-keyed balances even for empty accounts, and `get_new_address`
  returns successive external addresses matching a reference wallet;
  Iguana-mode HD requests stay refused.

## 38.9 Provenance Footer

- *Inputs:* the project's own revision history and current tree, for the
  T-DOC baseline of §38.1-§38.5 (Qtum split/staking-param naming,
  config-driven maturity, baseline address types, KMD rewards/dust
  policy, `sign_raw_transaction`, `consolidate_utxos`, the chain-variant
  model shared with [Chapter 37](37-utxo-spv-and-block-header-validation.md)
  §37.5 -- by public behaviour and config-key shape only, no code
  transcribed); published BIP-341/342 (Taproot), BIP-44/BIP-84 (HD
  derivation), and Electrum protocol documentation (public specifications
  for the §38.6/§38.8 port targets); KIP-0001 and the public Komodo daemon
  interest rule, plus the issue #11 KMD mainnet observations (§38.4,
  §38.10); [Chapter 5](05-hd-wallet-and-key-derivation.md)
  §5.9A (the software-HD crypto substrate §38.8 consumes); [Chapter 7](07-mnemonic-and-passphrase-management.md)
  (a cross-referenced sibling chapter); [Chapter 45](45-startup-configuration-and-environment-tolerance.md)
  (a cross-referenced sibling chapter).
- *Permitted-input classes used:* baseline/as-built source (the shipped
  UTXO maintenance surface, for the T-DOC majority); external public
  specification (BIP-341/342, BIP-44/BIP-84, the Electrum protocol);
  cross-chapter contracts (Chapters 5, 7, 37, 45). For the §38.6/§38.8
  scope determination itself -- identifying which post-2022 UTXO
  features (PoSV, Taproot, P2PK, connection prioritisation, balance
  streaming, fixed-fee policy, FIRO Spark) exist upstream and are
  genuinely absent from reloaded's baseline -- Forbidden corpus, under
  the chapter-01 two-team clean-room workflow; see below.
- *Sibling-allowlist consultations:* [Chapter 5](05-hd-wallet-and-key-derivation.md)
  §5.9A, [Chapter 37](37-utxo-spv-and-block-header-validation.md) §37.5.
- *Two-team workflow record:* the Spec Reader role (AGENTS.md §2) was
  used, and the Dirty Gate passed, for the absence-verification and
  feature-scope determination of §38.6/§38.8 only -- identifying that PoSV support, Taproot output
  handling, P2PK balance/spend, Electrum connection prioritisation, UTXO
  balance event streaming, fixed-fee/min-volume policy, and FIRO Spark
  verbose-tx support exist upstream and are absent from reloaded's
  baseline. The behavioural contracts themselves (R38.6.x, R38.8.x) are
  independently authored specification bound to public protocol
  documentation (BIPs, Electrum protocol) and this project's own
  software-HD substrate, not corpus expression. §38.4 (R38.4.1–R38.4.3)
  was re-derived on 2026-09-27 for issue #11 under the same workflow. The
  reward rule is bound to the public Komodo daemon consensus rule and
  KIP-0001 (§38.10). The corpus was consulted only to confirm that both
  reference lineages apply the same public rule and to supply the
  code-quality finding. No other section of this chapter draws on the
  two-team workflow.
- *Forbidden corpus:* not consulted.
