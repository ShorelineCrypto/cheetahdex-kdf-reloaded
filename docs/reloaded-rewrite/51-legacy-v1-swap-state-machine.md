# Chapter 51 — Legacy (V1) Atomic-Swap State Machine

**Status:** driving-spec.

The two role-specific command-driven, event-sourced state machines that
execute the legacy (version-`1`) five-stage hash-time-locked-contract
atomic swap — their complete stage and event sets, every success,
failure, refusal and abort transition with its exact triggering
condition, the peer-to-peer message contract and timeout budget that
drives them, the per-stage reserved-funds semantics including release on
unsuccessful termination, and the fixed-width field expectations the
negotiation and swap-status messages impose on the wire.

## 51.1 Executive Summary

[Chapter 13](13-swap-version-negotiation.md) binds the version tag that
selects between the legacy swap protocol (value `1`) and the
version-two protocol (values `2` and `3`). Chapter 13 R4 names the
legacy value but deliberately does not specify the protocol it selects;
[chapter 14](14-state-machine-runtime.md) binds the generic persistent
state-machine runtime that the *version-two* paths of chapters 15, 16
and 17 are built on, and the legacy paths explicitly do **not** use that
runtime. [Chapter 44](44-database-persistence-and-migrations.md) binds
the persisted encoding of the legacy event vocabulary but not its
semantics. The legacy protocol itself — by far the most widely deployed
swap protocol on netid `8762` — has therefore had no governing chapter.
This chapter closes that gap.

The legacy swap is executed independently by both counterparties. Each
side runs a single-threaded loop over a *stage* value: the loop invokes
the handler for the current stage, the handler performs input/output and
returns a (possibly empty) ordered list of *events* plus the next stage,
each event is applied to in-memory state and appended to a persistent
per-swap event log, and the loop repeats until a handler returns no next
stage. The event log is the sole recovery record: on restart the last
persisted event alone determines which stage to resume at. There is no
compile-time transition validator, no reentrancy trait, and no storage
abstraction of the kind chapter 14 binds — the legacy machines predate
all of it and must not be retrofitted onto it, because doing so would
change the persisted log shape that deployed peers and graphical clients
already parse.

Three properties of the legacy machine are specified here for the first
time and are the practical reason this chapter exists:

1. **The refusal signal.** The negotiation acknowledgement carried on
   the wire is a boolean. Both a positive and a *negative* value are
   transmitted by conforming peers. A maker that rejects a taker's
   negotiation reply, for any of seven distinct reasons, transmits the
   negative value before terminating. A taker that receives the negative
   value terminates immediately and penalises the maker. An
   implementation that never emits the negative value leaves its
   counterparty waiting out the full receive budget on every rejected
   negotiation, and is therefore not wire conformant.
2. **Reservation release.** Every unfinished swap reserves trade volume
   and fee headroom against the node's tradable balance. The reservation
   is released by removing the swap from the in-memory running-swap
   registry when the run loop exits — including when it exits before any
   transaction has been broadcast. A registry that only releases the
   entry when the swap object is dropped, or that keys the reservation
   on whether a transaction was sent, permanently shrinks the node's
   tradable balance on every failed negotiation.
3. **Fixed-width key fields.** The negotiation message's public-key
   fields are fixed at 33 bytes on the wire and are rejected at any
   other length. Chains whose keys are not 33-byte secp256k1 values
   occupy the field by a dictated padding convention rather than by
   varying the length.

Bound rules R1–R7 cover the run loop and lifecycle; R8–R19 the maker
stage graph; R20–R32 the taker stage graph; R33–R40 the refusal and
abort contract; R41–R50 the message contract and timeout budget;
R51–R58 the reserved-funds semantics; R59–R66 the wire field and type
expectations; R67–R70 the reference-version split.

## 51.2 Subsystem Shape

The substrate is two parallel role-specific machines plus four shared
services they both consume:

| Surface                          | Responsibility                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Maker stage machine              | Twelve stages, twenty-seven event types (R8–R19).                              |
| Taker stage machine              | Thirteen stages, thirty-one event types (R20–R32).                             |
| Per-swap message inbox           | Single-slot-per-message-kind store, sender-pinned (R41–R44).                    |
| Repeating broadcast service      | Re-transmits one message on an interval until cancelled (R45–R47).              |
| Running-swap registry            | Keyed set of live swaps; the sole source of trade-volume reservations (R51).    |
| Per-swap exclusion lock          | Time-to-live lock preventing two runners for one swap identifier (R5).          |

Both machines are anchored to the same per-swap publish-subscribe topic,
which is the swap topic prefix joined to the swap's identifier. All
legacy swap traffic for one swap, in both directions, travels on that
one topic.

The substrate has three external dependencies it does not own: the
coin-layer swap operations (payment construction, validation, spend,
refund, confirmation waiting), the fee descriptor and its arithmetic
bound by [chapter 08](08-fee-routing-engine.md), and the persistence
layer bound by [chapter 44](44-database-persistence-and-migrations.md).

**Chapter-bound identifiers.** The stage names used throughout this
chapter (`STAGE-START`, `STAGE-NEGOTIATE`, and the rest) are bound by
this chapter as its own contract surface. They are descriptive names for
positions in the state graph; they are not required to appear in any
implementation, and the graph is fully recoverable from the persisted
event vocabulary alone (R7). By contrast, every event-type name and
every message-kind name quoted in this chapter is externally dictated:
event-type names are the `type` discriminants of the persisted and
RPC-exposed event objects bound by chapter 44, and message-kind names
are the variant discriminants of the swap message envelope that a
counterparty must decode.

## 51.3 Bound Run-Loop and Lifecycle Contract

**R1.** *Two-value handler result.* Each stage handler MUST return a
pair: an optional next stage, and an ordered list of zero or more
events. Returning no next stage terminates the run. Every handler MUST
return successfully in normal operation; a stage's failure is expressed
as a failure *event* plus a next stage, never as a run-loop error. This
is what makes every failure path recoverable and inspectable rather than
losing the swap on an unwind.

**R2.** *Per-event ordering.* For each event a handler returns, in list
order, the runner MUST perform the following steps in exactly this
order:

1. evaluate the counterparty-penalty predicate for the event and, if it
   holds, record a time-bounded penalty against the counterparty's
   persistent public key (R40);
2. apply the event to the machine's in-memory state;
3. emit the event on the swap-status notification stream;
4. append the event, together with a millisecond timestamp, to the
   persistent per-swap event log and await completion of that append.

Only after every event of a handler's result has been appended may the
runner invoke the next stage's handler. A stage's wire output is
therefore always transmitted *before* the event describing it is
persisted; a crash between the two is recovered by the resumption rule
of R7 replaying the stage.

**R3.** *Persistence is blocking and fatal.* The event-log append of
R2 step 4 MUST be awaited. A failure to persist MUST NOT be swallowed
and MUST NOT allow the loop to advance, because the log is the only
recovery record and a gap in it silently changes the resume point.

**R4.** *Termination sequence.* When a handler returns no next stage,
the runner MUST, in order: mark the swap finished in persistent
storage; broadcast the node's own swap status to the swap topic (R48);
exit the loop; and then release the swap's entry in the running-swap
registry (R51). The registry release MUST occur on every exit path,
including exits caused by failure or refusal.

**R5.** *Single runner per swap.* Before any stage runs, the runner MUST
acquire a per-swap-identifier exclusion lock with a forty-second
time-to-live. If the lock is held, the runner MUST wait one full
time-to-live period and retry exactly once; if the lock is still held it
MUST abandon the run without emitting any event. While the run
proceeds, the lock MUST be refreshed on a thirty-second interval, i.e.
strictly more often than its time-to-live, so that a live runner never
appears expired.

**R6.** *Two entry modes.* The runner MUST support starting a fresh swap
at `STAGE-START` and resuming a persisted swap from its event log. On
resume, if the log's last event yields no next stage, the swap is
already finished and the runner MUST abandon the run without emitting
any event.

**R7.** *Resumption is a total function of the last event.* Every event
type MUST map to exactly one resume stage, or to termination. The map is
bound per role by R19 and R32. Two consequences are load-bearing: the
resume point never depends on in-memory state, and a stage is replayed
in full when the crash occurred between its wire output and its event
append, so every stage handler MUST tolerate being re-executed after a
partial effect (for example, by first searching the chain for a payment
it may already have broadcast).

## 51.4 Bound Maker Stage Graph

**R8.** *Stage set.* The maker machine MUST have exactly twelve stages:
`STAGE-START`, `STAGE-NEGOTIATE`, `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-FEE`,
`STAGE-SEND-MAKER-PAYMENT`, `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-PAYMENT`,
`STAGE-VALIDATE-TAKER-PAYMENT`, `STAGE-SPEND-TAKER-PAYMENT`,
`STAGE-CONFIRM-SPEND`, `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`, `STAGE-REFUND-EXECUTE`,
`STAGE-REFUND-FINALIZE`, and `STAGE-FINISH`. `STAGE-FINISH` MUST emit
the terminal event and return no next stage.

**R9.** *Start.* `STAGE-START` MUST, in order: obtain the sender-side
trade-fee estimate for the maker coin at the swap-start approximation
stage; obtain the receiver-side trade-fee estimate for the taker coin;
verify the node's balance covers the maker volume plus both estimates,
excluding amounts already reserved by other swaps (R53); record the
current wall-clock second as the swap start time; and read the current
block height of both coins. Failure of any of these five steps MUST
emit `StartFailed` and transition to `STAGE-FINISH`. On success it MUST
emit `Started` carrying the swap's frozen parameter set and transition
to `STAGE-NEGOTIATE`.

**R10.** *Locktime derivation.* The `Started` parameter set MUST fix the
maker payment locktime as the swap start time plus the lock duration
scaled by the taker coin's maker-locktime multiplier, rounded up. The
lock duration itself is the negotiated payment locktime for the coin
pair. This value is what the counterparty independently recomputes and
compares in R11 and R25; it MUST NOT be re-derived later in the swap.

**R11.** *Negotiate.* `STAGE-NEGOTIATE` MUST begin repeatedly
broadcasting the maker's negotiation message (R41, R45) and then wait
for the taker's negotiation reply within the negotiation budget (R46).
It MUST then apply five acceptance checks, in this order:

| # | Check                                                                                      | On failure                       |
|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | The reply arrived within the receive budget.                                                | `NegotiateFailed`, refuse (R34)  |
| 2 | The absolute difference between the two sides' declared start times is at most 60 seconds.  | `NegotiateFailed`, refuse        |
| 3 | The taker's declared payment locktime equals the taker's declared start time plus the lock duration exactly. | `NegotiateFailed`, refuse |
| 4 | Each coin accepts the counterparty's declared swap-contract address for that coin.          | `NegotiateFailed`, refuse        |
| 5 | Each coin accepts the counterparty's declared per-coin hash-time-locked-contract public key as a well-formed key for that coin. | `NegotiateFailed`, refuse |

Every failure MUST transition to `STAGE-FINISH`. On success it MUST emit
`Negotiated`, carrying the taker's payment locktime, the two negotiated
swap-contract addresses, and the taker's two per-coin public keys, and
transition to `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-FEE`.

**R12.** *Clock-skew bound.* The 60-second bound of R11 check 2 is the
protocol's clock-agreement tolerance and MUST be exactly 60 seconds. It
is three times the peer-to-peer layer's per-peer clock-gap tolerance;
implementations MUST NOT widen it, because both sides derive locktimes
from their own clocks and check 3 would otherwise admit a pair whose
locktimes disagree.

**R13.** *Await taker fee.* `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-FEE` MUST begin
repeatedly broadcasting the *positive* negotiation acknowledgement
(R35) and wait for the taker's fee message within the fee budget (R46).
It MUST then: validate any payment instructions carried alongside the
fee against the maker's own secret hash, amount and maker-side lock
duration; compute the expected fee descriptor for the taker coin, the
maker coin ticker, the taker volume and the taker's taker-coin public
key; and — unless the descriptor is the no-fee form — decode and
validate the fee transaction against the expected sender, the expected
descriptor and the taker-coin start block. Any failure MUST emit
`TakerFeeValidateFailed` and transition to `STAGE-FINISH`.

**R14.** *No-fee short circuit.* When the fee descriptor for the trade
is the no-fee form, `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-FEE` MUST NOT require or decode a
fee transaction. It MUST emit `TakerFeeValidated` carrying an
empty transaction identifier — empty transaction bytes and empty hash
bytes — and proceed. The empty identifier is the dictated
representation of "no fee transaction exists" in the persisted log and
in the counterparty-visible status; it MUST NOT be replaced by an absent
field.

**R15.** *Fee-validation retries.* On-chain validation of the fee
transaction MUST be retried a bounded number of times with a fixed
delay between attempts before being treated as a failure, so that a
transaction not yet visible to the maker's node does not fail an
otherwise valid swap. Both the attempt bound and the delay are fixed
values shared with other fee-validating call sites and are not
per-swap-configurable.

**R16.** *Instructions event always emitted.* `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-FEE`
MUST emit `MakerPaymentInstructionsReceived` on the success path
regardless of whether instructions were present, carrying the validated
instructions or their absence. It MUST be emitted *before*
`TakerFeeValidated`. The event is a success event and resumes at the
same stage that produced it (R19), which is what makes the
re-entrant replay of R7 safe here.

**R17.** *Send maker payment and await taker payment.*
`STAGE-SEND-MAKER-PAYMENT` MUST search the chain for a maker payment it
may already have broadcast before constructing a new one, then broadcast
the maker payment and emit `MakerPaymentSent`, transitioning to
`STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-PAYMENT`. Failure to construct or broadcast MUST emit
`MakerPaymentTransactionFailed` and transition to `STAGE-FINISH` — this
is the last maker failure that terminates without a refund, because no
maker funds are yet committed. `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-PAYMENT` MUST then, in
order: assemble and repeatedly broadcast the maker payment message
(R45); wait for the maker payment to reach its required confirmation
count, with a deadline of the swap start time plus two fifths of the
lock duration; and wait for the taker's payment message for three
fifths of the lock duration. Failure to assemble the payment message
MUST emit `MakerPaymentDataSendFailed`; failure to confirm MUST emit
`MakerPaymentWaitConfirmFailed`; a missing, late or undecodable taker
payment MUST emit `TakerPaymentValidateFailed`. Each of these three MUST
be immediately followed by `MakerPaymentWaitRefundStarted` carrying the
refund deadline (R18) and MUST transition to `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`.

**R18.** *Refund deadline and refund chain.* The maker's refund deadline
MUST be the maker payment locktime plus 3700 seconds. Every maker
failure occurring after `MakerPaymentSent` MUST route into the
three-stage refund chain: `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE` notifies the taker coin
that a maker refund is beginning and emits `MakerPaymentRefundStarted`;
`STAGE-REFUND-EXECUTE` waits until the coin reports the
hash-time-locked contract refundable (polling, with a fixed retry delay
on transient errors), broadcasts the refund and emits
`MakerPaymentRefunded`, or emits `MakerPaymentRefundFailed` and goes to
`STAGE-FINISH`; `STAGE-REFUND-FINALIZE` notifies the taker coin of
refund success and emits `MakerPaymentRefundFinished`. For a coin that
refunds automatically the execute stage MUST instead wait for the coin's
own refund to complete and emit `MakerPaymentRefunded` with no
transaction identifier.

**R19.** *Maker event set and resume map.* The maker machine MUST use
exactly the twenty-seven event types below, with exactly these resume
stages. Twelve are success events and fifteen are error events; the
split MUST be exposed verbatim in the persisted record's
`success_events` and `error_events` arrays (R49).

| Event type                          | Class   | Resumes at                  |
|-------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|
| `Started`                           | success | `STAGE-NEGOTIATE`           |
| `StartFailed`                       | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`              |
| `Negotiated`                        | success | `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-FEE`     |
| `NegotiateFailed`                   | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`              |
| `MakerPaymentInstructionsReceived`  | success | `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-FEE`     |
| `TakerFeeValidated`                 | success | `STAGE-SEND-MAKER-PAYMENT`  |
| `TakerFeeValidateFailed`            | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`              |
| `MakerPaymentSent`                  | success | `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-PAYMENT` |
| `MakerPaymentTransactionFailed`     | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`              |
| `MakerPaymentDataSendFailed`        | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`      |
| `MakerPaymentWaitConfirmFailed`     | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`      |
| `TakerPaymentReceived`              | success | `STAGE-VALIDATE-TAKER-PAYMENT` |
| `TakerPaymentWaitConfirmStarted`    | success | `STAGE-VALIDATE-TAKER-PAYMENT` |
| `TakerPaymentValidatedAndConfirmed` | success | `STAGE-SPEND-TAKER-PAYMENT` |
| `TakerPaymentValidateFailed`        | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`      |
| `TakerPaymentWaitConfirmFailed`     | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`      |
| `TakerPaymentSpent`                 | success | `STAGE-CONFIRM-SPEND`       |
| `TakerPaymentSpendFailed`           | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`      |
| `TakerPaymentSpendConfirmStarted`   | success | `STAGE-CONFIRM-SPEND`       |
| `TakerPaymentSpendConfirmed`        | success | `STAGE-FINISH`              |
| `TakerPaymentSpendConfirmFailed`    | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`      |
| `MakerPaymentWaitRefundStarted`     | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`      |
| `MakerPaymentRefundStarted`         | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-EXECUTE`      |
| `MakerPaymentRefunded`              | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-FINALIZE`     |
| `MakerPaymentRefundFailed`          | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`              |
| `MakerPaymentRefundFinished`        | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`              |
| `Finished`                          | success | (terminates)                |

`MakerPaymentWaitRefundStarted` carries a refund deadline field; every
other error event carries a swap-error payload; the remaining events
carry the payloads bound by chapter 44 R44.8A.2.

The two intermediate stages not otherwise described are
`STAGE-VALIDATE-TAKER-PAYMENT`, which waits for the taker payment's
confirmations against a deadline of the swap start time plus four fifths
of the lock duration and then validates the payment's script, amount,
locktime, counterparty key and secret hash — emitting
`TakerPaymentWaitConfirmFailed` or `TakerPaymentValidateFailed` plus
`MakerPaymentWaitRefundStarted` into the refund chain on failure, and
`TakerPaymentValidatedAndConfirmed` on success — and
`STAGE-SPEND-TAKER-PAYMENT`, which first checks that the same four-fifths
deadline has not passed, then broadcasts the spend revealing the secret
and emits `TakerPaymentSpent` plus `TakerPaymentSpendConfirmStarted`.
`STAGE-CONFIRM-SPEND` waits for the spend's confirmations with the
refund deadline as its cut-off and emits `TakerPaymentSpendConfirmed`.

## 51.5 Bound Taker Stage Graph

**R20.** *Stage set.* The taker machine MUST have exactly thirteen
stages: `STAGE-START`, `STAGE-NEGOTIATE`, `STAGE-SEND-TAKER-FEE`,
`STAGE-AWAIT-MAKER-PAYMENT`, `STAGE-VALIDATE-MAKER-PAYMENT`,
`STAGE-SEND-TAKER-PAYMENT`, `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-PAYMENT-SPEND`,
`STAGE-SPEND-MAKER-PAYMENT`, `STAGE-CONFIRM-MAKER-PAYMENT-SPEND`,
`STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`, `STAGE-REFUND-EXECUTE`, `STAGE-REFUND-FINALIZE`,
and `STAGE-FINISH`.

**R21.** *Start.* `STAGE-START` MUST obtain three trade-fee estimates —
the fee to send the taker fee transaction, the taker payment's own trade
fee, and the fee to spend the maker payment — verify the balance covers
the taker volume plus the dex fee plus those estimates excluding other
swaps' reservations, and read both coins' current block heights. Any
failure MUST emit `StartFailed` and transition to `STAGE-FINISH`.

**R22.** *Taker deadlines.* The `Started` parameter set MUST fix:

| Derived value                | Definition                                                        |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| taker payment locktime       | swap start time + lock duration                                   |
| maker-payment wait deadline  | swap start time + two fifths of the lock duration                 |
| taker-fee send deadline      | swap start time + one third of the lock duration                  |
| taker refund deadline        | taker payment locktime + 3700 seconds                             |

The taker's locktime is one lock duration where the maker's is the lock
duration scaled by the maker-locktime multiplier (R10); this asymmetry
is the protocol's safety margin and MUST be preserved.

**R23.** *Negotiate — receive first.* Unlike the maker, the taker's
`STAGE-NEGOTIATE` MUST *first* wait for the maker's negotiation message
within the negotiation budget, and only then reply. This ordering is
what makes the maker the party that adjudicates the negotiation and the
taker the party that can be refused.

**R24.** *Taker acceptance checks.* On receiving the maker's negotiation
message the taker MUST apply, in order: the same 60-second start-time
agreement check as R11 check 2; a check that the maker's declared
payment locktime equals the maker's declared start time plus *twice* the
lock duration; and per-coin acceptance of both declared swap-contract
addresses. Any failure MUST emit `NegotiateFailed` and transition to
`STAGE-FINISH`. The taker MUST NOT transmit a refusal signal — the
refusal signal is maker-directional only (R33).

**R25.** *Taker locktime expectation asymmetry.* The taker's expectation
in R24 is start time plus twice the lock duration, whereas the maker's
expectation in R11 check 3 is start time plus one lock duration. This
asymmetry is not an error and MUST be preserved exactly; it mirrors R22.

**R26.** *Reply then await acknowledgement.* After its checks pass, the
taker MUST derive its own negotiation reply — echoing the maker's secret
hash and the two negotiated swap-contract addresses, and carrying its
own two per-coin public keys and its own start time and payment
locktime — begin repeatedly broadcasting it (R45), and wait for the
negotiation acknowledgement within the negotiation budget. It MUST then
apply two further checks:

| # | Check                                                | On failure                      |
|---|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 6 | An acknowledgement arrived within the budget.        | `NegotiateFailed`, `STAGE-FINISH` |
| 7 | The acknowledgement's boolean value is positive.     | `NegotiateFailed`, `STAGE-FINISH` |

Check 7 is the taker's handling of the refusal signal and MUST be
present. On success the taker MUST emit `Negotiated` carrying the
maker's payment locktime, the maker's secret hash, the two negotiated
swap-contract addresses and the maker's two per-coin public keys, and
transition to `STAGE-SEND-TAKER-FEE`.

**R27.** *Send taker fee.* `STAGE-SEND-TAKER-FEE` MUST first check that
the taker-fee send deadline of R22 has not passed, emitting
`TakerFeeSendFailed` and transitioning to `STAGE-FINISH` if it has. It
MUST then compute the fee descriptor from the taker coin, the maker coin
ticker, the taker volume and the taker's own taker-coin public key. If
the descriptor is the no-fee form it MUST NOT broadcast anything and
MUST emit `TakerFeeSent` with the empty transaction identifier of R14.
Otherwise it MUST broadcast the fee transaction, emitting
`TakerFeeSendFailed` and transitioning to `STAGE-FINISH` on failure and
`TakerFeeSent` on success.

**R28.** *Await and validate maker payment.* `STAGE-AWAIT-MAKER-PAYMENT`
MUST repeatedly broadcast the taker fee message (R45) and wait for the
maker payment message within the maker-payment budget (R46). Failure to
assemble the fee message, a receive timeout, invalid payment
instructions, or an undecodable maker payment MUST each emit
`MakerPaymentValidateFailed` and transition to `STAGE-FINISH`. On
success it MUST emit, in order, `TakerPaymentInstructionsReceived`,
`MakerPaymentReceived` and `MakerPaymentWaitConfirmStarted`.
`STAGE-VALIDATE-MAKER-PAYMENT` MUST then wait for the maker payment's
confirmations with the maker-payment wait deadline of R22 as its cut-off
— emitting `MakerPaymentWaitConfirmFailed` on timeout — and validate the
payment, emitting `MakerPaymentValidateFailed` on rejection. Both
transition to `STAGE-FINISH`: up to and including this point the taker
has committed only the dex fee, and there is nothing to refund.

**R29.** *Send taker payment.* `STAGE-SEND-TAKER-PAYMENT` MUST first
search the chain for a taker payment it may already have broadcast. Only
if none is found MUST it check that the maker-payment wait deadline has
not passed. Failure of the search or a passed deadline MUST emit
`TakerPaymentTransactionFailed` and transition to `STAGE-FINISH`. On
success it MUST emit `TakerPaymentSent`. This search-before-deadline
ordering is required by R7: a replayed stage must not refuse to continue
a swap whose payment is already on chain merely because the send window
has since closed.

**R30.** *Await spend.* `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-PAYMENT-SPEND` MUST
repeatedly broadcast the taker payment message on a fifteen-second
interval and, when the coin pair supports third-party watchers and both
watcher preimages exist, repeatedly broadcast the watcher message on a
six-hundred-second interval on the watcher topic bound by
[chapter 09](09-watcher-reward-infrastructure.md), emitting
`WatcherMessageSent`. It MUST then poll for a spend of the taker payment
on a ten-second interval until the taker payment locktime. On timeout it
MUST emit `TakerPaymentWaitForSpendFailed` followed by
`TakerPaymentWaitRefundStarted` carrying the refund deadline, and
transition to `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`. On observing the spend it MUST
extract the secret from the spending transaction — emitting
`TakerPaymentWaitForSpendFailed` and transitioning to `STAGE-FINISH` if
extraction fails, which is the one post-payment taker failure that does
*not* enter the refund chain — and otherwise emit `TakerPaymentSpent`
carrying both the spending transaction and the recovered secret.

**R31.** *Spend maker payment and refund chain.*
`STAGE-SPEND-MAKER-PAYMENT` MUST broadcast the spend of the maker
payment using the recovered secret, emitting `MakerPaymentSpent` on
success or `MakerPaymentSpendFailed` into the refund chain on failure.
`STAGE-CONFIRM-MAKER-PAYMENT-SPEND` MUST wait for that spend's
confirmations, emitting `MakerPaymentSpendConfirmed` or
`MakerPaymentSpendConfirmFailed`. The taker refund chain mirrors R18
with taker-side event names: prepare emits `TakerPaymentRefundStarted`,
execute emits `TakerPaymentRefunded` or `TakerPaymentRefundFailed`, and
finalize emits `TakerPaymentRefundFinished`.

**R32.** *Taker event set and resume map.* The taker machine MUST use
exactly the thirty-one event types below with exactly these resume
stages.

| Event type                            | Class   | Resumes at                          |
|---------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------|
| `Started`                             | success | `STAGE-NEGOTIATE`                   |
| `StartFailed`                         | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`                      |
| `Negotiated`                          | success | `STAGE-SEND-TAKER-FEE`              |
| `NegotiateFailed`                     | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`                      |
| `TakerFeeSent`                        | success | `STAGE-AWAIT-MAKER-PAYMENT`         |
| `TakerFeeSendFailed`                  | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`                      |
| `TakerPaymentInstructionsReceived`    | success | `STAGE-VALIDATE-MAKER-PAYMENT`      |
| `MakerPaymentReceived`                | success | `STAGE-VALIDATE-MAKER-PAYMENT`      |
| `MakerPaymentWaitConfirmStarted`      | success | `STAGE-VALIDATE-MAKER-PAYMENT`      |
| `MakerPaymentValidatedAndConfirmed`   | success | `STAGE-SEND-TAKER-PAYMENT`          |
| `MakerPaymentValidateFailed`          | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`                      |
| `MakerPaymentWaitConfirmFailed`       | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`                      |
| `TakerPaymentSent`                    | success | `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-PAYMENT-SPEND`   |
| `WatcherMessageSent`                  | success | `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-PAYMENT-SPEND`   |
| `TakerPaymentTransactionFailed`       | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`                      |
| `TakerPaymentDataSendFailed`          | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`              |
| `TakerPaymentWaitConfirmFailed`       | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`              |
| `TakerPaymentSpent`                   | success | `STAGE-SPEND-MAKER-PAYMENT`         |
| `TakerPaymentWaitForSpendFailed`      | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`              |
| `MakerPaymentSpent`                   | success | `STAGE-CONFIRM-MAKER-PAYMENT-SPEND` |
| `MakerPaymentSpendConfirmed`          | success | `STAGE-FINISH`                      |
| `MakerPaymentSpendConfirmFailed`      | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`              |
| `MakerPaymentSpentByWatcher`          | success | `STAGE-CONFIRM-MAKER-PAYMENT-SPEND` |
| `MakerPaymentSpendFailed`             | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`              |
| `TakerPaymentWaitRefundStarted`       | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-PREPARE`              |
| `TakerPaymentRefundStarted`           | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-EXECUTE`              |
| `TakerPaymentRefunded`                | error   | `STAGE-REFUND-FINALIZE`             |
| `TakerPaymentRefundedByWatcher`       | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`                      |
| `TakerPaymentRefundFailed`            | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`                      |
| `TakerPaymentRefundFinished`          | error   | `STAGE-FINISH`                      |
| `Finished`                            | success | (terminates)                        |

Note the deliberate classification anomalies that MUST be preserved:
`TakerPaymentWaitForSpendFailed` is an error event that nevertheless
occurs on a swap the taker may still complete, and the entire refund
family including successful refunds is classified as error, because the
classification answers "did the swap complete as a trade", not "did the
node act correctly". `MakerPaymentSpentByWatcher` and
`TakerPaymentRefundedByWatcher` are watcher-outcome events that a node
may never emit itself but MUST accept in a persisted log
(chapter 44 R44.8A.5).

**R32A.** *Two success-event vocabularies.* The persisted
`success_events` array (R49) MUST carry the twelve-entry watcher-free
vocabulary when the swap does not use watchers and the fourteen-entry
vocabulary that additionally contains `WatcherMessageSent` and
`MakerPaymentSpentByWatcher` when it does. The `error_events` array is
the same seventeen entries in both cases.

## 51.6 Bound Refusal and Abort Contract

This section is normative for the behaviour that motivated the chapter:
a conforming peer transmits an explicit negative negotiation
acknowledgement, and an implementation that cannot emit one is not wire
conformant.

**R33.** *The refusal signal exists and is maker-directional.* The
negotiation acknowledgement message carries a boolean. The positive
value means "negotiation accepted, proceed"; the negative value means
"negotiation refused, do not proceed". Only the maker transmits this
message, because only the maker adjudicates the counterparty's
negotiation reply (R23). The taker MUST be able to receive and act on
both values (R26 check 7); the maker MUST be able to transmit both.

**R34.** *The seven refusal conditions.* The maker MUST transmit the
negative acknowledgement, exactly once, immediately before emitting
`NegotiateFailed` and terminating, in each of the following seven
conditions and in no others:

| # | Condition                                                                                   |
|---|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | The taker's negotiation reply did not arrive within the negotiation receive budget.          |
| 2 | The two sides' declared start times differ by more than 60 seconds.                          |
| 3 | The taker's declared payment locktime is not exactly the taker's start time plus the lock duration. |
| 4 | The maker coin rejects the counterparty's declared maker-coin swap-contract address.          |
| 5 | The taker coin rejects the counterparty's declared taker-coin swap-contract address.          |
| 6 | The maker coin rejects the counterparty's declared maker-coin public key as malformed.        |
| 7 | The taker coin rejects the counterparty's declared taker-coin public key as malformed.        |

Conditions 1 through 5 correspond to checks 1 through 4 of R11 with the
two contract-address checks separated; conditions 6 and 7 are R11
check 5 separated per coin.

**R35.** *Refusal is one-shot, acceptance is repeated.* The negative
acknowledgement MUST be transmitted as a single broadcast, not on a
repeating schedule. The positive acknowledgement MUST be transmitted on
a repeating schedule for the duration of the subsequent stage (R13,
R45). The asymmetry is deliberate: the refusing maker is about to stop
running and has no stage in which to maintain a repeat loop, whereas the
accepting maker must keep re-announcing acceptance until the taker's fee
arrives.

**R36.** *Refusal precedes persistence.* The refusal broadcast MUST be
issued before the `NegotiateFailed` event is returned by the stage
handler, and therefore before that event is applied, streamed or
persisted (R2). A maker that persists first and transmits second can
lose the refusal entirely on a crash, leaving the taker to time out.

**R37.** *Refusal on receive-timeout is still transmitted.* Condition 1
of R34 requires transmitting a refusal even though the reason for
refusing is that nothing was received. This is not vacuous: the taker
may have been broadcasting its reply on a channel the maker's node could
not read while the taker can read the maker's, and the refusal converts
the taker's remaining wait into an immediate termination.

**R38.** *No other refusal signal exists.* There is no refusal message
for any later stage. Every failure after negotiation is communicated
only by the absence of the expected next message and by the terminal
swap-status broadcast of R48. Implementations MUST NOT invent additional
refusal messages on the legacy topic, because a peer that does not
recognise the message kind will fail to decode the envelope.

**R39.** *Abort without any event.* Three conditions MUST abort a run
without emitting or persisting any event at all: failure to acquire the
per-swap exclusion lock after one retry (R5); resuming a swap whose
persisted log is already terminal (R6); and a failure to load the
persisted swap record on resume. An aborted run MUST still release its
running-swap registry entry if one was taken.

**R40.** *Counterparty penalty predicate.* The penalty step of R2 step 1
MUST fire on exactly these events: for the taker, `NegotiateFailed`,
`MakerPaymentValidateFailed`, and `TakerPaymentWaitForSpendFailed`; for
the maker, `TakerFeeValidateFailed` and `TakerPaymentValidateFailed`.
The penalty MUST be recorded against the counterparty's persistent
public key, MUST carry the swap identifier and the causing event as its
reason, and MUST expire after one hour. Note the direct consequence of
R33 and R34 together: a maker that transmits a refusal causes the
refused taker to penalise that maker's public key for an hour, because
the taker's refusal handling produces `NegotiateFailed`, which is in the
taker's penalty set. Refusal is therefore correct behaviour but not
cost-free, and MUST NOT be emitted outside R34's seven conditions.

## 51.7 Bound Message Contract

**R41.** *Six message kinds, one envelope.* The legacy swap message
envelope MUST carry exactly six kinds, in this discriminant order:
`Negotiation` (negotiation data), `NegotiationReply` (negotiation data),
`Negotiated` (boolean), `TakerFee` (opaque payload), `MakerPayment`
(opaque payload), `TakerPayment` (opaque payload). The order is
wire-significant; a new kind is appended, never inserted, and no kind is
removed.

**R42.** *Direction and stage.* Each kind MUST be sent only in the stage
and direction below.

| Kind               | Direction        | Sent during                                     | Awaited during                                  |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Negotiation`      | maker → taker    | maker `STAGE-NEGOTIATE`                         | taker `STAGE-NEGOTIATE` (first half)            |
| `NegotiationReply` | taker → maker    | taker `STAGE-NEGOTIATE` (second half)           | maker `STAGE-NEGOTIATE`                         |
| `Negotiated`       | maker → taker    | maker `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-FEE` (positive) or once at maker `STAGE-NEGOTIATE` refusal (negative) | taker `STAGE-NEGOTIATE` (second half) |
| `TakerFee`         | taker → maker    | taker `STAGE-AWAIT-MAKER-PAYMENT`               | maker `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-FEE`                   |
| `MakerPayment`     | maker → taker    | maker `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-PAYMENT`               | taker `STAGE-AWAIT-MAKER-PAYMENT`               |
| `TakerPayment`     | taker → maker    | taker `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-PAYMENT-SPEND`         | maker `STAGE-AWAIT-TAKER-PAYMENT`               |

Note that each side broadcasts its outgoing message during the stage in
which it awaits the *reply*, not during the stage that produced it. This
is what makes the repeat loop of R45 terminate naturally when the reply
arrives.

**R43.** *Signed envelope, pinned sender.* Every message MUST be
serialised, signed, and broadcast on the swap topic. On receipt the
runner MUST decode and verify the signature, then MUST accept the
message only if the recovered sender key equals the counterparty key
pinned when the swap's inbox was created. A message from any other
sender MUST be discarded without effect. Where the swap uses a
per-swap ephemeral signing key, that key signs; otherwise the node's
persistent key signs.

**R44.** *Single-slot inbox with take-on-read.* The per-swap inbox MUST
hold at most one payload per message kind, and reading a slot MUST clear
it. A later message of the same kind overwrites an unread earlier one.
The consequence, which implementations MUST preserve, is that the
repeated broadcasts of R45 are idempotent at the receiver and that a
message arriving before its awaiting stage begins is not lost.

**R45.** *Repeat-until-cancelled broadcast.* Outgoing messages other
than the negative acknowledgement MUST be broadcast on a repeating
interval, and the repeat MUST be cancelled as soon as the awaited reply
is received. The intervals are:

| Message                                       | Interval                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `Negotiation`, `NegotiationReply`             | negotiation budget ÷ 6 = 15 s   |
| `Negotiated` (positive)                       | fee budget ÷ 6 = 100 s          |
| `TakerFee`                                    | maker-payment budget ÷ 6 = 100 s |
| `MakerPayment`, `TakerPayment`                | 15 s (fixed)                    |
| Watcher message (watcher topic, chapter 09)   | 600 s (fixed)                   |

The fixed fifteen-second interval on the two payment messages is
deliberately shorter than a sixth of its budget so that a
mobile client that is foregrounded only briefly still transmits or
receives it.

**R46.** *Receive budgets.* Every receive MUST be bounded by a
per-stage budget plus a fixed ninety-second grace allowance added to
every budget, and MUST poll at one-second resolution. The stage budgets
are:

| Await                                            | Stage budget            | Total with grace |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Negotiation message / reply / acknowledgement    | 90 s                    | 180 s            |
| Taker fee message (maker side)                   | 600 s                   | 690 s            |
| Maker payment message (taker side)               | 600 s                   | 690 s            |
| Taker payment message (maker side)               | ⅗ × lock duration       | + 90 s           |

**R47.** *Non-message waits.* Waits that are not message receives MUST
use their own deadlines and poll intervals: confirmation waits poll at
fifteen seconds against a stage-specific deadline (R17, R19, R28); the
taker's spend search polls at ten seconds until the taker payment
locktime (R30); refundability polling retries after thirty seconds on a
transient coin error (R18).

**R48.** *Terminal swap-status broadcast.* On termination (R4) each side
MUST load its own completed swap record, redact secret material from
it, and broadcast it on the swap topic as an unsigned JSON object with
exactly two members: a `method` member whose value is the fixed string
`swapstatus`, and a `data` member carrying the redacted record. This
message is deliberately *not* wrapped in the signed envelope of R43.

**R49.** *Receiver handling of the status broadcast.* A receiver that
fails to decode an incoming payload as the signed envelope of R43 MUST
attempt to decode it as the R48 status object, and on success MUST store
the record in its counterparty-statistics store. Only if both decodes
fail is the payload discarded. Implementations MUST retain this
two-attempt fallback: it is the only mechanism by which a node learns
its counterparty's terminal outcome.

**R50.** *Secret redaction is mandatory.* The redaction of R48 MUST
remove the maker's secret from the broadcast record. The record is
broadcast on a public topic; a maker that broadcasts an unredacted
record before its own spend confirms discloses the secret to any
observer.

## 51.8 Bound Reserved-Funds Semantics

**R51.** *Reservation follows registry membership.* A swap's funds are
reserved for exactly as long as the swap has an entry in the in-memory
running-swap registry. The entry MUST be created before the first stage
runs and MUST be removed when the run loop exits (R4, R39). The registry
MUST be keyed by swap identifier so that removal is exact and
unconditional; a design in which entries expire only when the swap
object is dropped, or in which removal is conditional on how the swap
ended, does not satisfy this rule.

**R52.** *A terminated swap reserves nothing.* Once a swap has
terminated, its contribution to every reservation total MUST be zero,
regardless of which transactions it did or did not broadcast. This
explicitly includes swaps that terminated during `STAGE-START` or
`STAGE-NEGOTIATE`, before any transaction existed. Any implementation
whose per-stage reservation predicates are phrased purely as "has
transaction X been sent yet?" MUST additionally short-circuit on
termination, because such predicates answer "not sent" forever for a
swap that ended before sending anything.

**R53.** *Reservation totals.* The reserved total for a coin MUST be the
sum, over all registry entries, of each entry's declared reserved
amounts for that coin, plus each declared trade fee whose coin matches
and which is not marked as payable out of the trading volume itself. A
variant of the total that excludes one named swap MUST exist and MUST be
the form used when checking the balance for that same swap, so a swap
never blocks itself.

**R54.** *Maker per-stage reservations.* The maker MUST declare:

| Condition                                    | Reserved                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maker payment not yet broadcast              | the full maker volume in the maker coin, plus the maker payment's trade fee |
| Taker payment not yet spent                  | zero volume in the taker coin, plus the taker-payment-spend trade fee |
| Swap terminated                              | nothing (R52)                                                   |

The zero-volume-with-fee entry is not redundant: it reserves the taker
coin fee headroom needed to claim the incoming payment, which would
otherwise be spendable by another trade and leave the swap unable to
collect.

**R55.** *Taker per-stage reservations.* The taker MUST declare:

| Condition                                    | Reserved                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Taker fee not yet broadcast                  | the dex fee amount in the taker coin, plus the fee-sending trade fee |
| Taker payment not yet broadcast              | the full taker volume in the taker coin, plus the taker payment's trade fee |
| Maker payment not yet spent                  | zero volume in the maker coin, plus the maker-payment-spend trade fee |
| Swap terminated                              | nothing (R52)                                                   |

**R56.** *Dex fee reservation uses the taker's own key.* The dex fee
amount reserved by R55 MUST be computed with the same inputs the taker
will later use to construct it — taker coin, maker coin ticker, taker
volume, and the taker's own taker-coin public key — so that a discounted
or no-fee trade (chapter 08) reserves the amount it will actually spend
rather than the undiscounted amount.

**R57.** *Release is not deferred to persistence.* The release of R51
MUST be observable immediately on termination in the same process. It
MUST NOT depend on the swap being marked finished in persistent storage,
on a subsequent restart, or on any garbage-collection pass, because the
reservation total feeds the maximum-tradable-volume computation that a
user or a market-making client may query in the next second.

**R58.** *Reservation is process-local.* The running-swap registry is
in-memory only and is cleared on restart; reservations are reconstructed
by resuming unfinished swaps from persistent storage (R6). It follows
that a reservation leak is unbounded within a process lifetime and is
cleared only by restarting, which is why R52 and R57 are stated as hard
requirements rather than as optimisations.

## 51.9 Bound Wire Field and Type Expectations

**R59.** *Three negotiation-data shapes, untagged.* The negotiation
payload of the `Negotiation` and `NegotiationReply` kinds MUST be one of
three shapes, discriminated by *structure* rather than by a tag, and
attempted in declaration order:

| Shape | Fields                                                                                                                   |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | `started_at`, `payment_locktime`, `secret_hash`, `persistent_pubkey`                                                     |
| 2     | shape 1 plus `maker_coin_swap_contract`, `taker_coin_swap_contract`                                                       |
| 3     | `started_at`, `payment_locktime`, `secret_hash`, `maker_coin_swap_contract`, `taker_coin_swap_contract`, `maker_coin_htlc_pub`, `taker_coin_htlc_pub` |

Field names and their order are dictated interop and MUST NOT change.

**R60.** *Shape selection on send.* A sender MUST emit shape 3 whenever
its two per-coin hash-time-locked-contract public keys differ from each
other or either differs from its persistent public key; otherwise it MUST
emit shape 2. Shape 1 MUST be accepted on receipt but MUST NOT be
emitted. This keeps a single-key node's messages decodable by peers that
predate the two-key split.

**R61.** *Accessor collapse.* A receiver MUST expose the two per-coin
public keys uniformly across all three shapes: for shapes 1 and 2 both
per-coin keys MUST resolve to `persistent_pubkey`; for shape 3 they
resolve to their own fields. Likewise, the two swap-contract fields MUST
resolve to absent for shape 1 and to their own values otherwise. A
receiver MUST NOT branch on shape anywhere else.

**R62.** *Public-key fields are exactly 33 bytes.* Every public-key
field in R59 — `persistent_pubkey`, `maker_coin_htlc_pub`,
`taker_coin_htlc_pub` — MUST be a fixed-width 33-byte value. It MUST be
serialised as a byte sequence of exactly 33 elements. A deserialiser
MUST accept either a byte string or a sequence and MUST reject, as a
length error, any input whose length is not exactly 33. There is no
variable-length public-key form on this wire.

**R63.** *The coin-layer key contract is 33 bytes for every chain.* The
coin-layer operation that derives a node's per-coin
hash-time-locked-contract public key MUST return exactly 33 bytes for
every supported chain, and the coin-layer operation that validates a
counterparty's key MUST accept exactly 33 bytes. This chapter binds
these two operations as `derive_htlc_pubkey` and `validate_other_pubkey`
respectively. Neither the swap machines nor the negotiation message may
be made key-length-polymorphic; the 33-byte width is a property of the
deployed wire format, not of secp256k1.

**R64.** *Representation of non-secp256k1 keys — the dictated padding
convention.* A chain whose native key is not a 33-byte secp256k1 point
MUST occupy the 33-byte field by a fixed, chain-specific convention
rather than by shortening the field. For a chain whose native key is a
32-byte Edwards-curve (ed25519) value, the dictated convention is:

- **on send:** place the 32 native key bytes in the field's *first* 32
  byte positions and set the final byte to zero;
- **on validate:** require the received field to be exactly 33 bytes,
  then interpret the *first* 32 bytes as the native key and ignore the
  final byte;
- **on use:** every downstream consumer that needs the native key MUST
  take the leading 32 bytes.

Both the padding position (trailing) and the pad value (zero) are
dictated by the deployed format and MUST be reproduced exactly; a
leading pad or a non-zero pad is not interoperable. A chain whose native
key is genuinely a 33-byte secp256k1 value (which includes chains built
on Cosmos-family software configured for secp256k1) uses the field
directly with no padding, and its validator MUST reject any input that
is not a well-formed secp256k1 point.

**R65.** *Secret-hash field width is shape-dependent.* The `secret_hash`
field MUST be a fixed-width 20-byte value in shape 1 and a
variable-length byte sequence in shapes 2 and 3. This asymmetry is
deliberate and MUST be preserved: shape 1 predates the introduction of
32-byte secret-hash algorithms, and widening it would make shape 1
ambiguous with shape 2 under the structural discrimination of R59.
A receiver MUST NOT assume 20 bytes when reading shapes 2 or 3.

**R66.** *Contract-address fields are opaque byte sequences.* The two
swap-contract fields MUST be variable-length byte sequences with no
length constraint, and an empty sequence MUST be the encoding of
"this coin has no swap contract". The per-coin acceptance check of R11
check 4 and R24 is the coin layer's, not the message layer's; the
message layer MUST NOT validate these fields.

## 51.10 Bound Reference-Version Split

**R67.** *The legacy state machine is identical across both reference
lineages.* For the substrate this chapter binds — the stage sets, the
event sets, the resume maps, the acceptance checks, the refusal
conditions, the message contract, the timeout budgets, the reservation
predicates, and the wire field widths — the `v2.6.0-beta` legacy
contract and the current v3-lineage legacy contract are the same. This
chapter therefore binds a single contract for both, and an
implementation does not need a reference-version switch anywhere in the
legacy swap machines.

**R68.** *Differences that exist are outside this substrate.* Where the
v3 lineage differs in the legacy files it does so only in: the dex-fee
rate and discount policy, which is bound by
[chapter 08](08-fee-routing-engine.md) and by the network configuration
and is therefore netid-selected, not swap-machine-selected; the
plumbing by which a watcher-reward amount reaches the coin layer, which
is an internal detail carrying no wire or persisted-log consequence; and
the argument lists of two coin-layer operations, likewise with no wire
consequence. None of these change any rule in this chapter.

**R69.** *Netid applicability.* Because R67 holds, the legacy swap
machines are netid-independent. Netid `8762` and netid `6133` MUST run
the identical legacy state machine. Everything netid-specific that a
legacy swap consumes — the dex fee policy, the dex fee recipient, the
discount ticker set — MUST be reached through the active network
configuration, consistent with the repository-wide rule that
network-specific behaviour is selected by configuration rather than by
divergent code paths.

**R70.** *No silent upgrade.* An implementation MUST NOT allow a v3-era
change to alter any rule in this chapter for netid `8762` without an
explicit, documented compatibility boundary. In particular the boolean
acknowledgement of R33 MUST NOT be widened into a richer refusal type,
and the 33-byte key width of R62 MUST NOT be relaxed, on either netid.

## 51.12 Tests

**T1.** *Resume map totality.* For each role, every event type in R19 /
R32 maps to exactly one resume stage or to termination, and the set of
event types accepted by the persisted-log parser (chapter 44 R44.8A.3 /
R44.8A.4) equals the set in the resume map.

**T2.** *Success/error partition.* For each role, the success and error
classifications of R19 / R32 partition the event set with no overlap and
no omission, and the emitted `success_events` / `error_events` arrays
equal the bound vocabularies of R32A.

**T3.** *Refusal on each of the seven conditions.* Seven maker-side
tests, one per row of R34, drive the maker into that condition and
assert that a negative acknowledgement is broadcast exactly once, that a
`NegotiateFailed` event is persisted after the broadcast, and that the
next stage is terminal.

**T4.** *Acceptance is repeated, refusal is not.* Asserts the positive
acknowledgement is re-broadcast on the R45 interval for the duration of
the fee-await stage, and that the negative acknowledgement is broadcast
exactly once with no repeat loop created.

**T5.** *Taker honours the refusal.* A taker driven to the
acknowledgement wait, given a negative value, terminates with
`NegotiateFailed` without sending a fee transaction, and records the
one-hour penalty against the maker's key (R40).

**T6.** *Taker honours the acknowledgement timeout.* The same taker,
given no acknowledgement at all, terminates with `NegotiateFailed` only
after the full 180-second budget of R46 has elapsed — distinguishing the
timeout path from the refusal path by elapsed time.

**T7.** *Clock-skew boundary.* Negotiation succeeds at a 60-second
start-time difference and both refuses and fails at 61 seconds, on both
roles.

**T8.** *Locktime expectation asymmetry.* A maker refuses a reply whose
payment locktime is start plus twice the lock duration, and a taker
fails a negotiation whose payment locktime is start plus one lock
duration — i.e. each role rejects the other role's formula.

**T9.** *Reservation released on pre-transaction failure.* A swap driven
to `NegotiateFailed` (both roles) contributes zero to the reserved total
for both coins immediately after termination, and the maximum tradable
volume returns to its pre-swap value in the same process without a
restart.

**T10.** *Reservation held while running.* The same swap, paused before
its first broadcast, contributes exactly the amounts of R54 / R55 to the
reserved total.

**T11.** *Self-exclusion.* The balance check performed for a swap
excludes that swap's own reservation, so a swap that is already
registered does not fail its own start check.

**T12.** *Trade-fee inclusion rule.* A declared trade fee marked as
payable out of the trading volume contributes zero to the reserved
total, while an unmarked one of the same amount contributes its amount.

**T13.** *Key-field length rejection.* Deserialising a negotiation
payload whose public-key field is 32 or 34 bytes fails with a length
error; exactly 33 bytes succeeds. Both the byte-string and the sequence
input forms are covered.

**T14.** *Ed25519 padding round trip.* For an ed25519-keyed chain, the
derived key field is 33 bytes whose final byte is zero and whose leading
32 bytes equal the native key; validation of that field succeeds;
validation of a 33-byte field whose leading 32 bytes are not a valid
curve point fails; and validation of a field of any other length fails.

**T15.** *Negotiation shape selection.* A node whose two per-coin keys
equal each other and its persistent key emits shape 2; a node whose keys
differ emits shape 3; a receiver resolves both per-coin keys to the
persistent key when given shape 1 or 2.

**T16.** *Secret-hash width.* A shape-1 payload with a 32-byte secret
hash is rejected; a shape-2 or shape-3 payload with a 32-byte secret
hash is accepted.

**T17.** *Sender pinning.* A correctly signed message from a key other
than the pinned counterparty key leaves every inbox slot unchanged.

**T18.** *Inbox overwrite and take-on-read.* Two successive messages of
one kind leave only the later payload readable, and reading a slot twice
yields the payload then nothing.

**T19.** *Status-broadcast fallback.* A payload that is not a valid
signed envelope but is a valid status object is stored in the
counterparty-statistics store; a payload that is neither is discarded
with no state change.

**T20.** *Secret redaction.* The terminal broadcast of a maker swap that
has revealed its secret on chain contains no secret material.

**T21.** *Replay safety of the payment stages.* Re-entering the maker
payment stage and the taker payment stage after the payment is already
on chain does not broadcast a second payment, and the taker payment
stage does not fail on an expired send deadline when its payment is
already on chain (R29).

**T22.** *Terminal-log resume aborts silently.* Resuming a swap whose
last persisted event is terminal emits no event and takes no registry
entry.

**T23.** *Reference-version equivalence.* The stage sets, event sets,
resume maps, acceptance checks, refusal conditions and budgets asserted
by T1–T22 hold identically when the swap is configured for netid `8762`
and for netid `6133` (R67, R69).

## 51.13 Deferred Work

**D1.** *Migration of the legacy machines onto the chapter-14 runtime.*
The legacy machines predate the persistent state-machine runtime and use
a hand-rolled loop. Migration is possible in principle but would have to
preserve the persisted log shape byte for byte (chapter 44) and the
resume maps of R19 / R32 exactly; it is not in scope.

**D2.** *A structured refusal reason.* R33 binds a boolean. A refusing
maker cannot tell the taker *why* it refused, so a taker cannot
distinguish a clock-skew refusal (retryable after a clock fix) from a
malformed-key refusal (not retryable). Widening the type is a wire break
and is prohibited by R70 on the current netids; carrying a reason in a
new, additively-numbered message kind (R41) is the migration path if it
is ever taken.

**D3.** *Penalty proportionality.* R40 applies the same one-hour penalty
to a counterparty that refused a negotiation for a clock-skew reason as
to one that sent an invalid payment. Differentiating the penalty by
cause is deferred.

**D4.** *Persistent reservation ledger.* R58 records that reservations
are process-local and rebuilt by resume. A persisted reservation ledger
would make the maximum-tradable-volume answer correct across a restart
before resumption completes; not in scope.

**D5.** *Refusal on the receive-timeout condition is unacknowledged.*
R37 requires transmitting a refusal to a peer the maker could not hear
from. Whether the peer hears the refusal is unverifiable, and no
retransmission is specified. A bounded retransmission of the negative
acknowledgement is deferred.

## 51.14 Baseline Verifications

The following are verifiable against the baseline state defined in
[chapter 02](02-baseline-state.md), commit
`c1d46c0c1592faa0860f704008b2b2381bc3840f`.

**V1.** The baseline tree contains both legacy role machines, their
stage enumerations, their event enumerations, and the six-kind message
envelope of R41. This chapter documents an existing baseline substrate;
it does not introduce one.

**V2.** The baseline tree contains the boolean negotiation
acknowledgement of R33 and the taker-side handling of its negative value
(R26 check 7). The baseline tree does **not** contain any maker-side
path that transmits the negative value. R34 is therefore the rule whose
absence from the present tree must be corrected; the receiving half of
the contract is already present and correct.

**V3.** The baseline tree's reservation predicates are phrased as
transaction-sent questions without a termination short-circuit, and the
baseline running-swap registry is a collection of weak references with
no keyed removal at termination. R51, R52 and R57 are therefore the
rules whose satisfaction requires a keyed registry with unconditional
removal on every exit path.

**V4.** The baseline tree's negotiation public-key fields are
variable-length byte sequences rather than the fixed 33-byte fields of
R62. Verifiable by inspection of the baseline negotiation payload
types. R62 through R64 are therefore tightening rules relative to the
baseline, and are required for interoperability with deployed peers that
reject any other length.

**V5.** The baseline maker refund path is a single stage, whereas R18
binds a three-stage prepare/execute/finalize chain with distinct
persisted events for each. The taker refund path is likewise a single
stage against R31's three. The additional events are already bound as
acceptable persisted values by chapter 44 R44.8A.3 and R44.8A.4, so no
persisted-log migration is implied.

**V6.** The baseline `WatcherMessageSent` event carries no payload,
whereas the reference lineages carry payload data on it. Chapter 44
R44.8A.5 already requires tolerant parsing of this event; this chapter
does not bind its payload shape.
