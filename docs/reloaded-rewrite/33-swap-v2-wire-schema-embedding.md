## 33.0 Why This Chapter is a B-gleec Embedding

The Swap V2 protocol of [Chapter 15](15-swap-v2-utxo-path.md)
runs between two peers — a maker and a taker — that may be
running independently-developed implementations of the
protocol. The wire format MUST be byte-identical across
every implementation, in every field of every message,
or the swap fails. The format is fixed by a Protocol
Buffers descriptor; changing any message name, field name,
field number, field type, or oneof tag is a breaking change
that requires a coordinated upgrade across every protocol
participant.

Re-expressing the descriptor in prose alone would lose the
fixed-encoding guarantee. The clean-room substrate of
[§1.11 R31](01-clean-room-rules.md) therefore permits a
**B-gleec embedding**: the descriptor is reproduced
verbatim in this chapter (no upstream comments preserved,
no field-renames, no field-number changes, no message-shape
changes) and the chapter wraps the descriptor in
fresh-authored CRD commentary that binds the substrate's
behaviour above the bytes.

The chapter-bound substrate is the file:
`mm2src/mm2_main/src/lp_swap/swap_v2.proto`.

## 33.1 Bound Descriptor (Verbatim)

The following Protocol Buffers descriptor is the chapter-
bound substrate, embedded verbatim. No field number, no
message name, no oneof tag in this section is open to
interpretation; the file is the contract.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package mm2_swap_v2.pb;

message SignedMessage {
  bytes from = 1;
  bytes signature = 2;
  bytes payload = 3;
}

message MakerNegotiation {
  uint64 started_at = 1;
  uint64 payment_locktime = 2;
  bytes secret_hash = 3;
  bytes maker_coin_htlc_pub = 4;
  bytes taker_coin_htlc_pub = 5;
  optional bytes maker_coin_swap_contract = 6;
  optional bytes taker_coin_swap_contract = 7;
  string taker_coin_address = 8;
}

message Abort {
  string reason = 1;
}

message TakerNegotiationData {
  uint64 started_at = 1;
  uint64 funding_locktime = 2;
  uint64 payment_locktime = 3;
  bytes taker_secret_hash = 4;
  bytes maker_coin_htlc_pub = 5;
  bytes taker_coin_htlc_pub = 6;
  optional bytes maker_coin_swap_contract = 7;
  optional bytes taker_coin_swap_contract = 8;
}

message TakerNegotiation {
  oneof action {
      TakerNegotiationData continue = 1;
      Abort abort = 2;
  }
}

message MakerNegotiated {
  bool negotiated = 1;
  optional string reason = 2;
}

message TakerFundingInfo {
  bytes tx_bytes = 1;
  optional bytes next_step_instructions = 2;
}

message TakerPaymentInfo {
  bytes tx_bytes = 1;
  optional bytes next_step_instructions = 2;
}

message MakerPaymentInfo {
  bytes tx_bytes = 1;
  optional bytes next_step_instructions = 2;
  bytes funding_preimage_sig = 3;
  bytes funding_preimage_tx = 4;
}

message TakerPaymentSpendPreimage {
  bytes signature = 1;
  bytes tx_preimage = 2;
}

message SwapMessage {
  oneof inner {
    MakerNegotiation maker_negotiation = 1;
    TakerNegotiation taker_negotiation = 2;
    MakerNegotiated maker_negotiated = 3;
    TakerFundingInfo taker_funding_info = 4;
    MakerPaymentInfo maker_payment_info = 5;
    TakerPaymentInfo taker_payment_info = 6;
    TakerPaymentSpendPreimage taker_payment_spend_preimage = 7;
  }
  bytes swap_uuid = 10;
}
```

## 33.2 Chapter-Bound Substrate Rules

**R1.** **Verbatim embedding.** The descriptor of §33.1 is
the chapter-bound substrate. The implementer MUST place
the file at the path `mm2src/mm2_main/src/lp_swap/swap_v2.proto`
with byte-identical content to the §33.1 block (excluding
fenced-code-block delimiters). Any divergence —
re-ordering, comment additions, field renames, field-number
changes, type changes, oneof-tag changes, package-name
changes, syntax-level changes — is a chapter violation.

**R2.** **`proto3` syntax.** The descriptor MUST declare
`syntax = "proto3";` as its first non-empty line. The
`proto3` choice fixes the wire-encoding semantics
(no default-value emission, `optional` is opt-in, scalar
default is zero).

**R3.** **Package name.** The descriptor MUST declare
package `mm2_swap_v2.pb`. The package name is part of the
Rust-binding generator's output path and changing it would
ripple through every `use` statement in the swap V2
modules.

**R4.** **Generated-Rust home.** The `prost`-generated Rust
binding MUST land at the module path
`crate::lp_swap::swap_v2_pb` (i.e., a sibling module of
the swap V2 path of [Chapter 15](15-swap-v2-utxo-path.md)).
The chapter-bound substrate's build script MUST invoke
`prost-build` to materialise this binding at compile time.
The file is **not** committed; it is regenerated on every
build.

## 33.3 Bound Message Semantics

This section binds the substrate's read of each message of
§33.1. Field numbers and types are taken from the
descriptor; field semantics are bound here.

### 33.3.1 `SignedMessage`

The outer envelope every Swap V2 message travels in.

| Field | # | Type | Semantic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `from` | 1 | `bytes` | The sender's libp2p-derived public key (compressed secp256k1, 33 bytes). |
| `signature` | 2 | `bytes` | ECDSA signature over `payload` produced by the keypair whose public key is `from`. |
| `payload` | 3 | `bytes` | The serialised inner message — a `SwapMessage` of §33.3.10. |

**R5.** Receivers MUST verify `signature` against `from`
over `payload` before deserialising the payload. A
verification failure MUST drop the message and MUST NOT
log the failing payload at INFO or higher.

### 33.3.2 `MakerNegotiation`

The maker's opening message of the negotiation phase.

| Field | # | Type | Semantic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `started_at` | 1 | `uint64` | Maker's wall-clock seconds-since-epoch at the moment the maker started this swap. Used by the taker to bound the maker's clock skew. |
| `payment_locktime` | 2 | `uint64` | Maker's chosen payment-script absolute lock time (seconds since epoch). |
| `secret_hash` | 3 | `bytes` | The HTLC secret hash. Length is fixed by the HTLC family (32 bytes for the SHA-256 family). |
| `maker_coin_htlc_pub` | 4 | `bytes` | Maker's HTLC pubkey on the maker-coin chain. |
| `taker_coin_htlc_pub` | 5 | `bytes` | Maker's HTLC pubkey on the taker-coin chain. |
| `maker_coin_swap_contract` | 6 | `optional bytes` | EVM-only: maker-coin chain's swap-contract address (20 bytes). Absent on UTXO/UTXO swaps. |
| `taker_coin_swap_contract` | 7 | `optional bytes` | EVM-only: taker-coin chain's swap-contract address. |
| `taker_coin_address` | 8 | `string` | The maker's expected taker-coin receiving address (chain-specific encoding). |

**R6.** The two `optional bytes` swap-contract fields MUST
be absent for UTXO-only swap pairs and present for any
swap where at least one side is an EVM chain.

### 33.3.3 `Abort`

A negotiation-abort message with a free-text reason.

| Field | # | Type | Semantic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reason` | 1 | `string` | Short human-readable abort reason. |

**R7.** `reason` MUST NOT carry secrets, internal paths,
or sensitive identifiers (per §1.11 / `AGENTS.md` security
rules). Receivers MUST treat the field as untrusted input
and MUST NOT log it at WARN or higher.

### 33.3.4 `TakerNegotiationData`

The taker's negotiation-data payload.

| Field | # | Type | Semantic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `started_at` | 1 | `uint64` | Taker's started-at timestamp (parallel to §33.3.2). |
| `funding_locktime` | 2 | `uint64` | Taker's chosen funding-script absolute lock time. |
| `payment_locktime` | 3 | `uint64` | Taker's chosen payment-script absolute lock time. |
| `taker_secret_hash` | 4 | `bytes` | The taker's secret hash for the funding HTLC. |
| `maker_coin_htlc_pub` | 5 | `bytes` | Taker's HTLC pubkey on the maker-coin chain. |
| `taker_coin_htlc_pub` | 6 | `bytes` | Taker's HTLC pubkey on the taker-coin chain. |
| `maker_coin_swap_contract` | 7 | `optional bytes` | EVM-only (parallel to §33.3.2). |
| `taker_coin_swap_contract` | 8 | `optional bytes` | EVM-only (parallel to §33.3.2). |

### 33.3.5 `TakerNegotiation`

A oneof envelope letting the taker either continue the
negotiation with data or abort it with a reason.

| Field | # | Type | Semantic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `action.continue` | 1 | `TakerNegotiationData` | The data-bearing path. |
| `action.abort` | 2 | `Abort` | The abort path. |

**R8.** The `oneof` MUST be exhaustive in the implementer's
match block: receiving neither branch (an empty oneof) is a
protocol violation and the connection MUST be dropped.

### 33.3.6 `MakerNegotiated`

The maker's accept/reject reply to the taker's negotiation.

| Field | # | Type | Semantic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `negotiated` | 1 | `bool` | Acceptance flag. |
| `reason` | 2 | `optional string` | Free-text rejection reason; present iff `negotiated == false`. |

**R9.** When `negotiated == true`, `reason` MUST be absent.
When `negotiated == false`, `reason` SHOULD be present.
Receivers MUST tolerate a missing `reason` even when
`negotiated == false` (the field is `optional`).

### 33.3.7 `TakerFundingInfo`

The taker's announcement of its funding transaction.

| Field | # | Type | Semantic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tx_bytes` | 1 | `bytes` | The serialised funding transaction. Format is the coin's native transaction format. |
| `next_step_instructions` | 2 | `optional bytes` | Forward-compatibility envelope for coin-specific next-step hints (e.g., spv-proof seed). |

### 33.3.8 `TakerPaymentInfo`

The taker's announcement of its payment transaction.
Structurally identical to `TakerFundingInfo`.

| Field | # | Type | Semantic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tx_bytes` | 1 | `bytes` | Serialised payment transaction. |
| `next_step_instructions` | 2 | `optional bytes` | Forward-compatibility envelope. |

### 33.3.9 `MakerPaymentInfo`

The maker's announcement of its payment transaction plus
its preimage signature against the taker's funding.

| Field | # | Type | Semantic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tx_bytes` | 1 | `bytes` | The maker's payment transaction. |
| `next_step_instructions` | 2 | `optional bytes` | Forward-compatibility envelope. |
| `funding_preimage_sig` | 3 | `bytes` | The maker's signature over the funding-spend preimage; the taker uses this to claim funding refund. |
| `funding_preimage_tx` | 4 | `bytes` | The funding-spend transaction in unsigned form (or partially signed; coin-specific). |

### 33.3.10 `TakerPaymentSpendPreimage`

The taker's payment-spend preimage and signature.

| Field | # | Type | Semantic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `signature` | 1 | `bytes` | The taker's signature over the preimage. |
| `tx_preimage` | 2 | `bytes` | The unsigned payment-spend transaction. |

### 33.3.11 `SwapMessage`

The top-level dispatch envelope. Carries a single inner
message variant plus the swap's UUID for correlation.

| Field | # | Type | Semantic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `inner.maker_negotiation` | 1 | `MakerNegotiation` | §33.3.2 |
| `inner.taker_negotiation` | 2 | `TakerNegotiation` | §33.3.5 |
| `inner.maker_negotiated` | 3 | `MakerNegotiated` | §33.3.6 |
| `inner.taker_funding_info` | 4 | `TakerFundingInfo` | §33.3.7 |
| `inner.maker_payment_info` | 5 | `MakerPaymentInfo` | §33.3.9 |
| `inner.taker_payment_info` | 6 | `TakerPaymentInfo` | §33.3.8 |
| `inner.taker_payment_spend_preimage` | 7 | `TakerPaymentSpendPreimage` | §33.3.10 |
| `swap_uuid` | 10 | `bytes` | The 16-byte UUID of the swap. Field number 10 (not 8) is bound; the gap between 7 and 10 is reserved for future inner variants and MUST NOT be reused for `swap_uuid`. |

**R10.** Receivers MUST drop a `SwapMessage` whose
`swap_uuid` is not 16 bytes or does not match a known swap
they are participating in.

**R11.** The field-number gap (8, 9) is part of the wire
contract. Future inner variants MUST take numbers 8 and 9
(in oneof position) before any new top-level field is
considered.

## 33.4 Outgoing Cross-References

The wire envelope's signature semantics of §33.3.1 R5 are
satisfied by the swap-uuid signing helpers of
[Chapter 15 §15.x](15-swap-v2-utxo-path.md). The wire
envelope's runtime decoder is the `prost`-generated module
of R4, consumed from the swap-V2 maker/taker state-machines
of [Chapters 15-17](15-swap-v2-utxo-path.md).

## 33.5 Tests

T1. **Round-trip test.** A test constructs every message
    type with representative payloads, encodes it,
    decodes it, asserts pointwise equality.

T2. **Field-number stability test.** A test loads the
    descriptor at build time (via `prost_build`'s
    introspection) and asserts the field-number map
    matches a hard-coded reference table. The reference
    table catches a silent rename of any field that left
    the field-number unchanged.

T3. **Unknown-field tolerance.** A test injects a payload
    with an unknown field number into a known message and
    asserts that the `prost` decoder silently drops the
    unknown field rather than failing. This is the
    forward-compatibility guarantee of the chapter-bound
    substrate.

## 33.6 Deferred Work

D1. **Protocol-version negotiation.** The chapter-bound
    substrate does not carry a protocol-version field. A
    version handshake (perhaps as a new top-level field
    `protocol_version` on `SwapMessage` taking field
    number 8) is deferred work. The deferral is
    conservative: peers running the same KDF version are
    the only currently-supported deployment.

D2. **Forward-secret signing keys.** The signing in
    §33.3.1 R5 uses the long-lived libp2p keypair. A
    per-swap ephemeral signing key would limit the blast
    radius of a key compromise. This is deferred work
    independent of this chapter.

## 33.8 Provenance Footer

This chapter is a B-gleec embedding per
[Chapter 1 §1.11 R31](01-clean-room-rules.md). The
descriptor of §33.1 is reproduced verbatim from the
upstream `swap_v2.proto` substrate; upstream prose is
not preserved. The §33.2–§33.6 commentary is clean-room
CRD authored from the descriptor's structural shape and
the substrate's runtime behaviour as bound in
[Chapters 15-17](15-swap-v2-utxo-path.md).
